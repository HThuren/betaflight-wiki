##BetaFlight 3.0  
3.0 is currently still in Alpha testing. This version has many changes in the under laying code so has its own section.  

Plan here to to list and explain only the differences from the previous 2.x version.

From Boris:
Just use things available in the configurator and leave the rest on default.

Betaflight has 2 different goals.
1) have super stable firmware with solid defaults to just be able to fly when you want

2) from scientific point of view it is good to keep improving and introduce new features where those who like to experiment can play with ans give valuable feedback. These are mostly burried in the cli
