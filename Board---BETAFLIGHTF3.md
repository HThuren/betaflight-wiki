_format is reporter [name], (status): issue contents_

 - The DSM2/SBUS pad is connected to RX2
 - LED_STRIP conflicts with motor 2 in Betaflight 3.1.0 when using DShot. Upgrade to version 3.1.6+ to fix it
 - The ground plane acts as a heatsink, making the ground (-) pads difficult to solder to. Preheat the area you're working on with a hot air station at 100째C - 150째C (200째F - 300째F) to make soldering faster and easier
 - SD card needs to be formatted to specific parameters
 - Current sensor needs to be calibrated in BF software

# Issue fixes
SD card:
 Samsung Evo class 10 series, 16GB or 32GB seem to work better than others
(this may or may not work)
1. Format card in SDcardformatter v4
2. Insert card, flash BF 3.1.3 (on usb only no extra power)
3. Straight to CLI and set sdcard_dma=on
4. Card should initialize and the icon in the blackbox tab under the BF GUI should show it green
5. back to CLI and set sdcard_dma=off

Current sensor:
There is a resistor that can be measured and scaling number can be calculated from that value
it may be in a different place but should be around there
