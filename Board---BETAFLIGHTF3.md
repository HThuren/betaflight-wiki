_format is reporter [name], (status): issue contents_

 - The DSM2/SBUS pad is connected to RX2
 - LED_STRIP conflicts with motor 2 in Betaflight 3.1.0 when using DShot. Upgrade to version 3.1.6+ to fix it
 - The ground plane acts as a heatsink, making the ground (-) pads difficult to solder to. Preheat the area you're working on with a hot air station at 100째C - 150째C (200째F - 300째F) to make soldering faster and easier
 - SD card needs to be formatted to specific parameters
 - Current sensor needs to be calibrated in BF software
 - Filtered 5v rail(RAM) is weak
 - osd and 16/9 cameras do produce flickers in the osd

## Issue fixes
### SD card:
 Samsung Evo class 10 series, 16GB or 32GB seem to work better than others
(this may or may not work)
1. Format card in SDcardformatter v4
2. Insert card, flash BF 3.1.3 (on usb only no extra power)
3. Straight to CLI and set sdcard_dma=on
4. Card should initialize and the icon in the blackbox tab under the BF GUI should show it green
5. back to CLI and set sdcard_dma=off

### Current sensor:
There is a resistor that can be measured and scaling number can be calculated from that value.

picture of resistor in link below
it may be in a different place but should be around there

here is the procedure for calculating the value

### Driver related problems
some people have been complaining about computer(windows pc's) not being able to see the board
The driver needs to be replaced with the generic WinUSB driver the configurator can use. Zadig or IRCDF does this job for you
