## Cygwin on Windows
ccache 3.1.9 in Cygwin 2.874 is broken. Returns false cache hits. Do not install. Betaflight build system uses ccache if available. 

## GNU ARM Toolchain Version
Using the 4.8-2014-q2 version of the [GNU ARM Toolchain](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download) with Windows/Cygwin (recommended on the Cleanflight "[Building in Windows.md](https://github.com/cleanflight/cleanflight/blob/master/docs/development/Building%20in%20Windows.md)" page) lead to strange results.  (When running a 2.9.1 version of Betaflight I built on NAZE the change-flight-mode beep would constantly sound when in Horizon mode.)  Updating the toolchain to 4.9-2015-q3 and rebuilding fixed the issue (and also cleared some compiler warnings).  BorisB mentions the toolchain version [here](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?p=34530653#post34530653).
