In order to convert between Betaflight, RaceFlight and FlightOne rates, the converters below can be used. For Actual Rates and KISS rates there doesn't seem to be a converter available currently. Instead use the comparison pages below and play with the sliders until the curves are the same.

The only difference between Quickrates and Betaflight rates is instead of the super rate Quickrates use the max velocity (velocity in degree/sec at maximum stick deflection). In order to convert Betaflight rates to Quickrates, just put your Betaflight rates in the configurator to see the max velocity. The max velocity can also bee used for Actual Rates, but the other two values have to be figured out by curve comparison.
