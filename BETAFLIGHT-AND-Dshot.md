# Dshot & BetaFlight   
Dshot is new and currently code is being developed and tested. Since there are many dependencies and not all current hardware works this is to help keep track.

The Official Thread for Dshot is: https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2756129   
Please Read this thread for details of how it works and up to date info. The First Post of this thread has all the needed Links to code and other info. A good article on Dshot and ESC protocols is here:   
https://blck.mn/2016/11/dshot-the-new-kid-on-the-block/  

In the Dshot thread is this post on how to re-Flash ESCs & FC:

For KISS FC's and ESCs see the KISS Dshot thread:

BetaFlight V3.1 development code for Dshot can be found here:   
http://andwho.sytes.net:8080/job/BorisB_BetaFlight/   
Just remember that this is very Experimental code and may have serious limitations.

Some known limitations are (
Note: these may or may not affect all working targets):
- BLHeli pass-through does not work if FC is set to DSHOT. Must change output to OneShot to use the pass-through.    
Note: should be fixed on most Targets but not all targets yet.   
- Some ESCs that have a signal filter cap may not work until the cap is removed. 
- BB logging  not working. Seems to work on many targets but unable to download to a file, erase worked.
- 3D mode not yet working, developer's plan is to get the basics working well the get 3D working.
- A bug affecting Spektrum Sats, shows 988 on channels in receiver tab of Betaflight (soon to be looked at).
   Fixed on SPRF3 & REVO, may be fixed on other targets.
- PPM not working on some FC targets (limited testing due to most users using Sbus or Spektrum)   
   Note: Some targets need motor re-mapped to PPM pin so then PPM can not be used.
- LEDs not working or must be disabled to have all motors working due the DMA mapping conflicts.  
- The 'target.c' source files show that only Quad copters are supported in most targets and some targets support Hex copters.
- Some targets do not work if a Custom mixer is enabled. Instead use the new "resource" CLI command instead. Just be aware that not all outputs (pins) can be assigned a DMA channel for Dshot.  

####A quick way to determine IF the hex flashed supports Dshot:  
Go to the CLI and type "get pwm". All settings with 'pwm' in the name will be shown with all options.
If DSHOT150, DSHOT300, DSHOT600 is NOT in the list for the "motor_pwm_protocol" then this firmware does NOT support Dshot.
Example from built 668 for MotoLab that does Not support Dshot: 

motor_pwm_protocol = ONESHOT42
Allowed values: OFF, ONESHOT125, ONESHOT42, MULTISHOT, BRUSHED

####Setting Min Throttle with Dshot   
Dshot now uses the CLI command "digital_idle_percent" and the old 'min_throttle' setting is ignored.
Do type "get idle" to see if this exists and what the valid values are. This is a percentage of throttle used in armed state. The pid controller will never push use motor output below this percentage. For example if your min throttle when using multishot was 1040 and your total throttle was 1000 (2000-1000) then you should set your digital idle offset to 4.0 as 40 is 4 percent of 1000. You can play with these values a little but if you experience motor/prop stalls during flight this number should be increased as having this value too low could be the cause of that behaviour.

####ESC Cal and min/max throttle
ÃŸF firmware with Dshot does Not use the min_throttle or max_throttle setting, these are ignored.
Just ensure that in the ESCs (BLHeli Suite) that PPM_MIN_THROTTLE is set to 1000 and PPM_MAX_THROTTLE is set to 2000.
Note: This should not be needed in BLHeli_S 16.43 since the PPM_MIN & MAX values are not used for Dshot.   

####Max ESC update speed supported by different dshot versions:
- dshot150: 8kHz max
- dshot300: 16kHz max
- dshot600: 32kHz max

Note: When DSHOT is enabled Unsyced PWM is disabled. DSHOT always runs at the PID loop rate.

###Starting with a post from the Dshot thread:

Scouring the BF and Dshot threads has resulted in the following lists. The information posted herein is all provided on an AS-IS basis.
It has been derived from posts on this forum (RCGroups/BEtaflight & DSHOT threads), and direct correspondences with users.

USE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION AT YOUR OWN RISK

BETAFLIGHT AND DSHOT -

Betaflight may not be able to support all Targets ( or specific boards) due to the design of each one differing on the DMA pinout. Look below to find what may or may not be working.

DSHOT on BLHELI_S ESCs will likely only support Dshot150 & 300.
Here is why: https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=36025232&postcount=376   
Now found that some BLHeli_S ESC will run on DSHOT600 with modifications. See list below for details.  
Rev16.5 is now posted on github (27Nov2016).   
Dshot150, Dshot300 and Dshot600 are now supported officially.  

###Flight Controllers Supporting Dshot on Betaflight 3.1 Alphas:
- BLUEJAYF4
- REVO (and clones)
- OMNIBUS
- OMNIBUSPRO (Blheli Configurator Hangs on read in 3.1, failed flash in 3.01)

####FC Targets that work with Dshot but require re-mapping pins with the Resource command:   
- MOTOLAB - (MotoF3, Tornado, Cyclone & Tempest)   
Boris' comment:  
I had many requests for MOTOLAB but that one doesn't have DMA available on all motors. It may be that we will assign one of the motors to PPM pin so you can resolder it. Not great, but better than nothing I guess?   
The new Betaflight 3.1 code has the "resource" CLI command . To use Dshot, you'll need move the motor 1 signal to the PPM pin. This is easily done with a wire soldered from the Motor1 pin to the PPM pin, do not cut an traces, just short these two pins together. Can not use a PPM RX after mapping motor1 to the PPM pin. 

3.1 Build #721: Bench tested -     Do the following to setup for Dshot.

`In Port Tab Set UART2 to SerialRX- save              ; Must use a serial port    `   
`In Config Tab Set RX to Serial (SBUS, etc)- save   ; Do NOT set ESC to DSHOT yet, leave as OneShot125    `   
`In CLI type:                                           `   
`resource ppm none                                  ; Disables use of PPM    `   
`resource motor 1 A07                               ; Assigns motor 1 to the PPM Pin    `   
`save                                               ; reboots    `   
`In Config Tab set to desired DSHOT protocol- save    `    
 
To use BLHeli Pass-through first set to OneShot in the config tab and Save. Then in the CLI set motor 1 back to the the original processor pin, A04, with the resource command. Save.  The wire from motor1 pin to the PPM pin does not need to be removed since the PPM pin is 'undefined' and is set to an input. BLHeli Suite can now be used to update ESC firmware and/or make changes to settings without removing the FC from the copter. When finished set Motor1 to the DMA channel on pin A07, Save. then select Dshot.

- SPRACINGF3EVO - Locked out Comm port fixed (build 708?). Must move MOTOR 4 to new pin assignment (CLI = resource MOTOR 4 A06). Then solder ESC for motor #4 to motor output #5, fixes DMA conflict with motor outputs 2 and 4. 
- PIKOBLX - re-map motor 1 to the PPM pin (same as MotoLab) and also disable motor 5-8 ("resource motor X none").   

See: [CLI resource command](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/Betaflight-specific-CLI-commands#resource-remapping-command-v31)

####Intermittent FC Reports:
- KOMBINI - reported not to connect to config (still on #721).  This FC needs to re-map the motor pin the same way as for the MotoLab FC. Reports are that this FC has the exact same pin out as the MotoLab FCs with the exception the Sbus in UART3.  Video on getting this FC working:   
https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=36269451&postcount=1966    

####FC Targets with DSHOT code added but in need of testing:
- FURYF3
- RACEBASE
- SPARKY2
- Seriously Pro Mini - locks up when Dshot selected. May work if motor pins are re-mapped.

###ESCs supporting Dshot:
