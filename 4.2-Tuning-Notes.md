Betaflight 4.2 includes a number of improvements and updates to flight performance and code efficiency.  Most users will find that there is a bit less jitter and a smoother feel overall.  

**4.2 should fly really well on defaults, with no modifications, with most quads.**

If you're new to 4.2, please read the 4.0 and 4.1 tuning notes.

Please use the latest [Betaflight Configurator](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator).  A [nightly build](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator-nightlies/releases) is available.

**NOTE 1**: DO NOT paste a diff or dump from any build before 4.1 into the 4.2 CLI.  A 4.1 `diff all` should be OK.  

**NOTE 2**: If you previously set `dyn_notch_range` to `LOW` or `HIGH`, you may want to change `dyn_notch_max_hz` to 350 or 700 - details [here](4.2-Tuning-Notes#Improved-dynamic-notch-filter).  
If your previous PID `I` values were different from default, you may want to change your anti-gravity gain values in 4.2 to get the same outcome - details [here](4.2-Tuning-Notes#Antigravity-gain-independent-of-I-values).  

**NOTE 3**: If you're new to 4.2, please start with stock filters and PIDs, unless you know for sure that your quad needs unusual settings.

We recommend enabling RPM based filtering.  4.2's more accurate PID loop timing markedly improves rpm filter precision.  Read about [enabling and configuring rpm filtering here.](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/Bidirectional-DSHOT-and-RPM-Filter)


## Quick settings 

These snippets provide suggestions for how some of the less common settings might be adjusted to suit a certain type of flying.  The defaults should be fine for fast freestyle and general racing requirements.  I can't say that they will be perfect on your quad, and they do not include PID tuning or filter values, but they might show the kind of ranges for some of these numbers.

**Race** (aggressive feed forward, requires a good clean RC signal, or might jitter from RC steps)
```
set iterm_relax_cutoff_hz = 35
set rc_smoothing_auto_smoothness = 7
set ff_interpolate_sp = ON
set ff_smooth_factor = 20
set ff_spike_limit = 70
set feedforward_transition = 0
set yaw_lowpass_hz = 100
set throttle_boost = 7
set throttle_boost_cutoff = 25
set dyn_lpf_dterm_curve_expo = 5
set gyro_rpm_notch_q = 500
```

**HD** (smoothed FF for HD cameras, low iterm relax to minimise bounce back)
```
set iterm_relax_cutoff_hz = 5

```

**Cinematic** (For slow rate turns only, may feel a bit 'dull' to fly otherwise)
```
set iterm_relax_cutoff_hz = 3
set rc_smoothing_auto_smoothness = 40
set ff_interpolate_sp = AVERAGED_4
set ff_smooth_factor = 50
set ff_spike_limit = 50
set feedforward_transition = 50
set yaw_lowpass_hz = 30
set throttle_boost = 2
set throttle_boost_cutoff = 10
set dyn_lpf_dterm_curve_expo = 8
```


## More accurate loop times

The basic gyro and PID loop scheduling has been completely rewritten, resulting in less PID loop jitter and reduced CPU utilisation.  No special configuration is required; it just works.

The main benefit is improved filter accuracy, especially for RPM and dynamic notch filtering.  This should lead to cooler motors and smoother flight.  You may now be able to set the RPM filter Q factor to a higher value, reducing delay, while maintaining good motor noise rejection.

The gyro loop rate is now locked at the 'native' gyro sampling rate.  This rate cannot be adjusted by the user.  The only filter that runs at gyro loop rate is gyro lowpass 2; everything else runs at PID loop rate.  

The PID loop rate can still be set to suit the capabilities of the processor.  F405 and F7xx boards should be fine with 8k PID loops, but F411's should be set to 4k.  Custom F3 builds can run 4k but are happier at 2k.

When running 4k or 2k PID loops, we need to prevent aliasing artefacts from down-sampling the 8k gyro data to the PID loop frequency.  The gyro lowpass 2 filter, which is on by default, would normally provide the required anti-aliasing functionality.  If gyro lowpass 2 is disabled, a simple 2-point averaging filter is automatically activated in its place, and also runs at gyro loop frequency.  The 2-point averaging filter will reduce, but not totally eliminate, aliasing artefacts in 4k PID loops.  It does not prevent aliasing artefacts in 2k PID loops.  

With a 4k PID loop, if you don't need gyro lowpass 2 for noise reduction purposes, set it as high as it can go (currently to 1000Hz) to provide the anti-aliasing functionality, or just turn it off. 

With a 2k PID loop, don't disable gyro lowpass 2.


## Improved Feed Forward

4.2 provides feed forward optimisations to suit everything from hard-core racing to cinematic HD.

When configured aggressively, Feed Forward reacts immediately to any stick input.  The basic feed forward component is proportional to the speed with which the sticks move, and the boost component is proportional to the instantaneous acceleration of the sticks.  When tuned effectively, aggressive feed forward can reduce setpoint to gyro delay to zero for most inputs, leading the high levels of control and immediacy required by the very best racers.

The primary downside of aggressive feed forward is jitter.  Most radios have some jitter in their signal, and many drop packets or send duplicate packets.  If the quad reacts immediately to the tiniest input, it may 'tremble' or be a bit nervous when it should be in smooth forward flight or during gentle long radius turns.

The needs of the race pilot differ greatly from those of a person wanting super smooth HD footage, so in 4.2 we've put a lot of thought into how best address these differing requirements.

Feed forward depends greatly on the stability of the RC link, and the smoothness of the steps between incoming packets.  We strongly recommend that Crossfire users update to the latest software (including the update to OpenTx that provides external module sync for CRSF) and that FrSky users upgrade to OpenTx 2.3 and disable ADC.

### Mode: ff_interpolated_sp

The most important feed forward parameter is the 'mode' in which feed forward operates, which can be set as follows using the `set ff_interpolated_sp` command in the CLI as follows:

- `OFF`: the older linear interpolation method, with no boost or glitch reduction
- `ON`: the newer setpoint based interpolation mode, with immediate response to every change in RC, with boost and glitch reduction, intended for racing
- `AVERAGED_2`: as above, but with two point moving averaging for glitch reduction and for elimination of alternating up/down FF jitter, but with reduced jitter when flying straight ahead or in smooth arcs.  For general purpose use, including racing and modern freestyle (default)
- `AVERAGED_3`: three point moving average glitch reduction, providing strong jitter reduction in smooth arcs or when flying straight ahead.  Intended for freestyle with HD cameras. Effectively reduces 3-step (20ms) jitter in locked 150hz Crossfire setups that haven't been upgraded to external module sync code.
- `AVERAGED_4`: four point moving average smoothing and strongest jitter reduction, best for smooth cinematic HD recordings.  Can also be effective in smoothing jittery R9 traces.

### Smoothness: ff_smooth_factor

Next most important is the 'smoothness' factor, which limits the amount of change that any one incoming radio step can make.  It acts like an exponential or lowpass type smoothing function.  The cli parameter is `ff_smooth_factor`.  Default is 37, max is 75.

With`set ff_smooth_factor = 0`, there is no smoothing of outgoing FF steps.  The full FF and boost amount for any given incoming RC step will be applied immediately.  This is probably what a racer with a clean radio setup would prefer.  

At the default of 37, 63% of the incoming feed forward step will be applied immediately.  The response is like a first order lowpass filter with a time constant of one RC interval (cutoff of 1000/2*pi*RCinterval Hz, or about 24hz for 6.66ms RC steps).  This parameter smooths out sharp steps in the FF signal, reducing some of the jitter component that is common with many radios.

Values above default will provide a smoother FF signal, but may cause so much delay as to make feed forward a bit useless.  Not recommended except on perhaps slow cinematic HD rigs.

### Boost: ff_boost

This hasn't changed since 4.1; please read the [4.1 tuning notes](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/4.1-Tuning-Notes#Feed-Forward-Boost) 

To summarise, boost responds to stick acceleration, and helps overcome motor lag with quick stick inputs.  It also generates RC jitter and glitch artefact better than anything else.  The default settings in 4.2 attempt to strike a good balance.

Default boost is 15, and that works for nearly all quads.  Racers may prefer 20.  Higher values are likely to cause micro overshoots, jitter and excessive sensitivity on normal quads, but up to 30 may be useful on low authority quads.

### Spike limiting: ff_spike_limit

`ff_spike_limit` provides simple soft cliping method, to chop the tops off large FF spikes.  The default should be acceptable for most radios.  Most people should leave this value at defaults.  

Higher numbers will allow progressively bigger spikes through.  Racers or people with clean radios who want full feed forward aggression can increase this value, but should look closely at their feed forward trace to see what happens.

The biggest normal single FF step change that a pilot ever generates is when they suddenly return from full stick deflection, ie on terminating a fast flip.  If having the least possible delay at this point is important, maye try shifting the spike limit higher.  

### Overshoot limiting: ff_max_rate_limit

`ff_max_rate_limit` also hasn't changed since 4.1, please read the [4.1 tuning notes ](4.1-Tuning-Notes#Feed-Forward-Limiting).

Executive summary - leave this at 100.


## Improved Dynamic Notch filter

The dynamic notch filter has been extensively revised.  It now identifies and tracks peaks more accurately, and over a wider frequency range.  Performance will be better on most quads.  It will also be more accurate with non-standard gyro rates.  

Instead of choosing a range using `AUTO`, `LOW`, `MEDIUM` or `HIGH`, the user now directly sets the actual maximum frequency that they want the dynamic notch to cover, using `dyn_notch_max_hz`.   The dynamic notch will then help control noise between its minimum and maximum frequency values.

The default `dyn_notch_max_hz` value works best for most quads, but can be tweaked.  The optimal value depends on whether or not you're using rpm filtering, and the rpm range of the quad.

If you were using `LOW`, `dyn_notch_max_hz` around 350hz should be roughly equivalent.  If you were using `HIGH`, probably around 700hz will be enough, I've not seen many quads actually get much higher in rpm that that.

When rpm filtering isn't being used, the dynamic notch needs to cover the full range of possible motor generated frequencies.  The value required can be determined accurately by logging with debug GYRO_SCALED and looking at the highest frequency reported in spectral analysis.  Alternatively it can be estimated as 70% of the peak theoretical no-load rpm.  For example, a 2000KV motor with 6S has no load rpm of 2000 * 6 * 4 = 48000 rpm.  70% of that is 33,600rpm, divide by 60 and you get 560hz.

Slow fliers and X-class quads may be better off with `dyn_notch_max_hz` set to say 350-400hz, and perhaps a lower `dyn_notch_min_hz` than defaults.  Lower maximum values will improve resolution over defaults.

With rpm filtering, the motor noise lines usually get removed completely, and often the dynamic notch has little to do.  In many cases it can be turned off.  However, it can be useful for attenuating residual noise or frame resonance.  If there is no particular frame resonance, it will sort of hover around the middle of its range.  With the defaults, this keeps it out of the way, causing relatively little delay.  

If there is a specific resonance at some particular frequency, the min and max values can be centered either side of the resonance line.  For example, if you have 150hz resonance, try setting minimum to 100 and max to 200.

No matter how low you set the max value, the value used internally will never be less than twice the minimum value.  This is necessary to ensure the code works properly.

The 4.1 tuning guide notes about notch width and Q factor still apply... in short, when using the rpm filter:

```
set dyn_notch_width_percent = 0
set dyn_notch_q = 250
```

And this restores the default values for use without RPM filtering
```
set dyn_notch_width_percent = 8
set dyn_notch_q = 120
```


## RC-smoothing-improvements

Following extensive testing, the default RC smoothing values were simplified and optimised.  Usually no changes from defaults are needed.  

The default auto smoothing method will dynamically calculate RC smoothing time constants from the identified RC packet intervals.  This works really well with most radio systems and with interpolated feed forward.  The default input filter type is `BIQUAD`, it smooths setpoint and P.  The derivative filter type is `PT1`, which smooths the sharp corners off the interpolated feed forward trace.

Most pilots should stick with the defaults.

`rc_smoothing_auto_factor` sets how 'smooth' the RC traces will be.  Higher values result in greater smoothness, but add RC delay.  10 is optimal for most general purpose flying.  Racers may prefer 8, or even 5, but will get more jumpy motor traces as a result, often not improving performance much if at all; for old jittery radios, 20 or even 40 may smooth out things a bit. 

These are the new default settings:
```
set rc_smoothing_type = FILTER
set rc_smoothing_input_hz = 0
set rc_smoothing_derivative_hz = 0
set rc_smoothing_input_type = BIQUAD
set rc_smoothing_derivative_type = PT1
set rc_smoothing_auto_factor = 10
``````


## Dynamic D filtering expo

`dyn_lpf_curve_expo` now makes the D lowpass filter cutoff value rise more quickly with throttle increases than it used to.  The rise in D lowpass now starts from the moment the throttle is increased.  Values of 5 or above may improve propwash control.  

The end-points, `dyn_lpf_dterm_min_hz` and `dyn_lpf_dterm_max_hz`, remain the same, the difference is that we get closer to max more quickly.  For graphs see [PR9365](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/9365).

Default is no change (0).
A value of 5 results in a linear increase with throttle.  Higher values may improve propwash by reducing delay at mid-throttle.  

A suitable starting value for propwash reduction is 7.

## Automatic anti-yaw spin configuration

Betaflight 4.2 now defaults to auto configure the `yaw_spin_threshold` to a value a small amount above the maximum configured yaw rate.  For most users this will allow yaw spin corrections to activate more quickly after hitting a gate and spinning.  Also, a user can now switch profiles from race (low rates) to freestyle (higher rates) to LOS (very high yaw rates) and the `yaw_spin_threshold` will always be appropriate.

The mode configuration is set in the CLI by `yaw_spin_recovery`.  This can be `OFF`, `ON`, or `AUTO`, with default to `AUTO`.  To manually configure the threshold, choose `ON` and set the value you want in `yaw_spin_threshold`.

We hope that AUTO to be best for all users.


## Antigravity gain independent of I values

Previously, the anti-gravity gain value acted as a multiplier of the PID `I` value.  This means that when PID `I` was increased, the strength of the anti-gravity effect also increased, and vice versa.  This could lead to I mediated wobbles on rapid changes of throttle if the user increased their PID `I` to high values, or, lead to inadequate anti-gravity effect if the user decreased PID `I`.

In 4.2, the anti-gravity effect is independent of the user's PID `I` value, and is modified by anti-gravity gain alone.  

If a user previously ran higher PID `I` values than default, they will need to increase their anti-gravity gain value, and vice versa, if they want the same anti-gravity effect as before.  The change should be in proportion to the ratio of their previous I value to the 4.1 and 4.2 default value.
