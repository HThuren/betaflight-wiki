Betaflight 4.2 brings solid improvements in flight performance.  Most users will find their quad flies smoother due to feed-forward improvements and stronger loop time stability.  Having more stable loop times has greatly improved RPM filter accuracy.  New rates methods, when used with the latest Configurator, provide an easy way to adjust centre stick feel independently of expo and maximum roll rate.  Enabling the dynamic D expo curve may improve propwash by letting the D filtering rise to higher values sooner.  The new dynamic battery sag compensation function, if enabled, provides consistent throttle and PID 'feel' throughout the flight, keeping hard turns on-radius better than before.  RC smoothing defaults are much improved and shouldn't need to be manually tweaked anymore.  Feed forward settings such as averaging and smoothing can be optimised for race to cinematic purposes.  

**4.2 should fly really well on defaults, with no modifications, with most quads.**

If you're new to 4.2, please read the 4.0 and 4.1 tuning notes.

Please use the latest [Betaflight Configurator](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator).  A [nightly build](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator-nightlies/releases) is available.

**NOTE 1**: DO NOT paste a diff or dump from any prior build into the 4.2 CLI.  

**NOTE 2**: If you previously set `dyn_notch_range` to `LOW` or `HIGH`, change `dyn_notch_max_hz` to 350 or 700 - details [here](4.2-Tuning-Notes#Improved-dynamic-notch-filter).  

**NOTE 3**:If your previous PID `I` values were changed from default, the anti-gravity gain values in 4.2 may need changing a little to get the same outcome - details [here](4.2-Tuning-Notes#Antigravity-gain-independent-of-I-values).  

**NOTE 4**: Please start with stock filters and PIDs, unless you know for sure that your quad needs unusual settings.

We recommend enabling RPM based filtering.  Read about [enabling and configuring rpm filtering here.](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/Bidirectional-DSHOT-and-RPM-Filter)


## Quick settings 

These snippets provide suggestions for how some of the less common settings might be adjusted to suit a certain type of flying.  The defaults should be fine for fast freestyle and general racing requirements.  I can't say that they will be perfect on your quad, and they do not include PID tuning or filter values, but they might show the kind of ranges for some of these numbers.

## That's all you really need to know... go fly!


### For hard-core tuners, here are the technical details:


## More accurate loop times

The basic gyro and PID loop scheduling has been completely rewritten, resulting in less PID loop jitter and reduced CPU utilisation.  No special configuration is required; it just works.

The main benefit is improved filter accuracy, especially for RPM and dynamic notch filtering.  This should lead to cooler motors and smoother flight.  You may now be able to set the RPM filter Q factor to a higher value, reducing delay, while maintaining good motor noise rejection.

The gyro loop rate is now locked at the 'native' gyro sampling rate.  This rate cannot be adjusted by the user.  The only filter that runs at gyro loop rate is gyro lowpass 2; everything else runs at PID loop rate.  

The PID loop rate can still be adjusted to suit the capabilities of the processor.  F405 and F7xx boards should be fine with 8k PID loops, but F411's should be set to 4k.  Custom F3 builds can run 4k but are happier at 2k.

When running 4k or 2k PID loops, we need to prevent aliasing artefacts from down-sampling the 8k gyro data to the PID loop frequency.  The gyro lowpass 2 filter is on by default to do this.  If it is disabled, a simple 2-point averaging filter is automatically enabled in its place, and runs at gyro loop frequency.  It reduces, but won't totally eliminate, aliasing artefacts in 4k PID loops.  It does not prevent aliasing artefacts in 2k PID loops.  

With a 4k PID loop, if you don't need gyro lowpass 2 for noise reduction purposes, set it as high as it can go (currently to 1000Hz) to provide the best anti-aliasing functionality, or just turn it off. 

With a 2k PID loop, don't disable gyro lowpass 2.


## Improved Feed Forward

4.2 provides feed forward optimisations to suit everything from hard-core racing to cinematic HD.

When configured aggressively, Feed Forward reacts immediately to any stick input.  The basic feed forward component is proportional to the speed with which the sticks move, and the boost component is proportional to the instantaneous acceleration of the sticks.  When tuned effectively, aggressive feed forward can reduce setpoint to gyro delay to zero for most inputs, leading the high levels of control and immediacy required by the very best racers.

The primary downside of aggressive feed forward is jitter.  Most radios have some jitter in their signal, and many drop packets or send duplicate packets.  If the quad reacts immediately to the tiniest input, it may 'tremble' or be a bit nervous when it should be in smooth forward flight or during gentle long radius turns.

The needs of the race pilot differ greatly from those of a person wanting super smooth HD footage, so in 4.2 we've put a lot of thought into how best address these differing requirements.

Feed forward depends greatly on the stability of the RC link, and the smoothness of the steps between incoming packets.  We strongly recommend that Crossfire users update to the latest software (including the update to OpenTx that provides external module sync for CRSF) and that FrSky users upgrade to OpenTx 2.3 and disable ADC.

### Mode: ff_interpolated_sp

The most important feed forward parameter is the 'mode' in which feed forward operates, which can be set as follows using the `set ff_interpolated_sp` command in the CLI as follows:

- `OFF`: the older linear interpolation method, with no boost or glitch reduction
- `ON`: the newer setpoint based interpolation mode, with immediate response to every change in RC, with boost and glitch reduction, intended for racing
- `AVERAGED_2`: as above, but with two point moving averaging for glitch reduction and for elimination of alternating up/down FF jitter, but with reduced jitter when flying straight ahead or in smooth arcs.  For general purpose use, including racing and modern freestyle (default)
- `AVERAGED_3`: three point moving average glitch reduction, providing strong jitter reduction in smooth arcs or when flying straight ahead.  Intended for freestyle with HD cameras. Effectively reduces 3-step (20ms) jitter in locked 150hz Crossfire setups that haven't been upgraded to external module sync code.
- `AVERAGED_4`: four point moving average smoothing and strongest jitter reduction, best for smooth cinematic HD recordings.  Can also be effective in smoothing jittery R9 traces.

### Smoothness: ff_smooth_factor

Next most important is the 'smoothness' factor, which limits the amount of change that any one incoming radio step can make.  It acts like an exponential or lowpass type smoothing function.  The cli parameter is `ff_smooth_factor`.  Default is 37, max is 75.

With`set ff_smooth_factor = 0`, there is no smoothing of outgoing FF steps.  The full FF and boost amount for any given incoming RC step will be applied immediately.  This is probably what a racer with a clean radio setup would prefer.  

At the default of 37, 63% of the incoming feed forward step will be applied immediately.  The response is like a first order lowpass filter with a time constant of one RC interval, i.e. a cutoff of (1000 / 2 * pi * RCinterval) Hz, or about 24Hz for 6.66ms RC steps.  This parameter smooths out sharp steps in the FF signal, reducing some of the jitter component that is common with many radios.

Values above default will provide a smoother FF signal, but may cause so much delay as to make feed forward a bit useless.  Not recommended except on perhaps slow cinematic HD rigs.

### Boost: ff_boost

This hasn't changed since 4.1; please read the [4.1 tuning notes](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/4.1-Tuning-Notes#Feed-Forward-Boost) 

To summarise, boost responds to stick acceleration, and helps overcome motor lag with quick stick inputs.  It also generates RC jitter and glitch artefact better than anything else.  The default settings in 4.2 attempt to strike a good balance.

Default boost is 15, and that works for nearly all quads.  Racers may prefer 20.  Higher values are likely to cause micro overshoots, jitter and excessive sensitivity on normal quads, but up to 30 may be useful on low authority quads.

### Spike limiting: ff_spike_limit

`ff_spike_limit` provides simple soft cliping method, to chop the tops off large FF spikes.  The default should be acceptable for most radios.  Most people should leave this value at defaults.  

Higher numbers will allow progressively bigger spikes through.  Racers or people with clean radios who want full feed forward aggression can increase this value, but should look closely at their feed forward trace to see what happens.

The biggest normal single FF step change that a pilot ever generates is when they suddenly return from full stick deflection, ie on terminating a fast flip.  If having the least possible delay at this point is important, maye try shifting the spike limit higher.  

### Overshoot limiting: ff_max_rate_limit

`ff_max_rate_limit` also hasn't changed since 4.1, please read the [4.1 tuning notes ](4.1-Tuning-Notes#Feed-Forward-Limiting).

Leave this at 100.





## RC-smoothing-improvements

Following extensive testing, the default RC smoothing values were simplified and optimised.  Usually no changes from defaults are needed.  

The default auto smoothing method will dynamically calculate RC smoothing time constants from the identified RC packet intervals.  This works really well with most radio systems and with interpolated feed forward.  The default input filter type is `BIQUAD`, it smooths setpoint and P.  The derivative filter type is `PT1`, which smooths the sharp corners off the interpolated feed forward trace.

Most pilots should stick with the defaults.

`rc_smoothing_auto_factor` sets how 'smooth' the RC traces will be.  Higher values result in greater smoothness, but add RC delay.  10 is optimal for most general purpose flying.  Racers may prefer 8, or even 5, but will get more jumpy motor traces as a result, often not improving performance much if at all; for old jittery radios, 20 or even 40 may smooth out things a bit. 

These are the new default settings:
```
set rc_smoothing_type = FILTER
set rc_smoothing_input_hz = 0
set rc_smoothing_derivative_hz = 0
set rc_smoothing_input_type = BIQUAD
set rc_smoothing_derivative_type = PT1
set rc_smoothing_auto_factor = 10
```


## Dynamic D filtering expo

`dyn_lpf_dterm_curve_expo` now makes the D lowpass filter cutoff value rise more quickly with throttle increases than it used to.  The rise in D lowpass now starts from the moment the throttle is increased.  Values of 5 or above may improve propwash control.  

The end-points, `dyn_lpf_dterm_min_hz` and `dyn_lpf_dterm_max_hz`, remain the same, the difference is that we get closer to max more quickly.  

- Default is no change (0).
- A value of 1 provides a very gentle curve - nearly linear - from min to max Hz over the full throttle range.
- A value of 5 results in a curved increase with throttle with a more rapid rise from min by mid-throttle.  
- The maximum of 10 results in a very quick rise.

For graphs see [PR9486](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/9486).

A suitable starting value for propwash reduction is 6.


## Dynamic battery sag compensation

This PR applies an initial motor output reduction when the battery is full, and boosts motor output upwards during the flight, to quickly compensate for sagging battery voltage as it happens.

This gives a more consistent stick feel, both for throttle and PID, over the usable battery voltage range, compensating for the usual loss of performance as the battery sags.  The quad will not feel super aggressive at the start of a flight, or dull at the end.

It is best enabled with:
```
set vbat_sag_compensation = 100
set vbat_pid_gain = OFF
```

This means '100% compensation for voltage sag'.

**NOTE:** The quad must have an on-board battery voltage sensor.  It can't be enabled with ESC based serial voltage telemetry, because the voltage values change too slowly.

The older `vbat_pid_gain` method of battery sag compensation should not be used at the same time.

**NOTE:**  Only use this if you have active battery monitoring via telemetry or OSD!**  You will get no loss of 'stick feel' until the battery starts falling below 3.5V.

The code compensates for voltage changes from 4.2V down to the user's configured warning voltage of 3.5V.

A fall from 4.2V to 3.5V is about a 16% reduction in voltage.  Withs 100% compensation, a motor output reduction of about 16% will be applied when the battery is full.  As the battery voltage falls, motor output is dynamically boosted back towards normal, canceling out the effect of the sag.  Once the battery falls to 3.5V or lower, motor output will be normal, or back to 100%, and no further compensation is possible.  

Both throttle and motor limits may need to be adjusted after enabling sag compensation.  If you already have a static `motor_output_limit` value below 100, this code further reduces motor output below that value.  You may want to lift `motor_output_limit` by about 10 for similar overall performance.  If you have a throttle limit, there is usually no need to change it.  

To  keep a bit more aggression at the start, at the cost of having a bit more 'sag' during the flight, apply less than full compensation, eg 50% compensation is `set vbat_sag_compensation = 50`.

Setting more than 100% compensation can help whoops that sag really badly, but usually isn't needed.

There are two kinds of battery sags: 

- Slow falls, over minutes, as the battery loses overall voltage and capacity
- Quick sags due to transient high current loads during throttle blips

To only cover the slow fall, set `vbat_sag_lpf_period` to 200 (20 seconds period, or a time constant of about 3.3 seconds).  This **will not** compensate for quick transient drops.  High values make sense for slow flyers or cinematic type flying.

To respond quickly, stick with the default `vbat_sag_lpf_period` of 2, or 200ms.  This has a time constant of about 33ms, fast enough to respond very quickly to fast throttle blips and quick split-S turn type sags. 

Whoops tend to be flown at lower voltages than mini quads, so the warning voltage is often set lower, eg 3.3V.  The attenuation range, and the initial maximum motor output suppression value, will be a bit bigger.  You may want to slightly reduce the compensation amount, eg to say 80%, if that wider range makes it feel just a bit too dull overall. 

When using HV cells, no adjustments are required.  

Enabling the `BATTERY` debug to show the compensation amounts, as they happen, in the OSD, or recorded in a log.

Battery debug 2 carries a 'compensationStrength' value, between 0 and 100.  Zero means you're at the low end of the battery range, and no further compensation is available.  100 means you've got a fresh battery and your maximum configured compensation is active.  

Battery debug 3 carries the actual percentage reduction applied to  motor output.  A normal value for a full battery would be about 160 (16%).  If you were to apply only 50% compensation, your would see only about 8% attenuation when full.  


## Automatic anti-yaw spin configuration

Betaflight 4.2 now defaults to auto configure the `yaw_spin_threshold` to a value a small amount above the maximum configured yaw rate.  For most users this will allow yaw spin corrections to activate more quickly after hitting a gate and spinning.  Also, a user can now switch profiles from race (low rates) to freestyle (higher rates) to LOS (very high yaw rates) and the `yaw_spin_threshold` will always be appropriate.

The mode configuration is set in the CLI by `yaw_spin_recovery`.  This can be `OFF`, `ON`, or `AUTO`, with default to `AUTO`.  To manually configure the threshold, choose `ON` and set the value you want in `yaw_spin_threshold`.

We hope that AUTO to be best for all users.  More info [here](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/9455)


## Antigravity gain independent of I values

Previously, the anti-gravity gain value acted as a multiplier of the PID `I` value.  This means that when PID `I` was increased, the strength of the anti-gravity effect also increased, and vice versa.  This could lead to I mediated wobbles on rapid changes of throttle if the user increased their PID `I` to high values, or, lead to inadequate anti-gravity effect if the user decreased PID `I`.

In 4.2, the anti-gravity effect is independent of the user's PID `I` value, and is modified by anti-gravity gain alone.  

If a user previously ran higher PID `I` values than default, they will need to increase their anti-gravity gain value, and vice versa, if they want the same anti-gravity effect as before.  The change should be in proportion to the ratio of their previous I value to the 4.1 and 4.2 default value.  


## Improved Dynamic Notch filter

The dynamic notch filter has been extensively revised.  It now identifies and tracks peaks more accurately, and over a wider frequency range.  Performance will be better on most quads.  It will also be more accurate with non-standard gyro rates.  

Instead of choosing a range using `AUTO`, `LOW`, `MEDIUM` or `HIGH`, the user now sets the actual maximum frequency that they want the dynamic notch to cover, using `dyn_notch_max_hz`.   The dynamic notch will then help control noise between its minimum and maximum frequency values.

The default `dyn_notch_max_hz` value of 600Hz works best for most quads, but can be tweaked.  The optimal value depends on whether or not you're using rpm filtering, and the rpm range of the quad.

If you were using `LOW`, `dyn_notch_max_hz` around 350hz should be roughly equivalent.  If you were using `HIGH`, probably around 700hz will be enough, I've not seen many quads actually get much higher in rpm that that.

When rpm filtering isn't being used, the dynamic notch needs to cover the full range of possible motor generated frequencies.  The value required can be determined accurately by logging with debug GYRO_SCALED and looking at the highest frequency reported in spectral analysis.  Alternatively it can be estimated as 70% of the peak theoretical no-load rpm.  For example, a 2000KV motor with 6S has no load rpm of 2000 * 6 * 4 = 48000 rpm.  70% of that is 33,600rpm, divide by 60 and you get 560hz.

Slow fliers and X-class quads should use `dyn_notch_max_hz` at say 350-400hz, and a lower `dyn_notch_min_hz` than defaults.  Lower maximum values will improve resolution over defaults.

With rpm filtering, the motor noise lines usually get removed completely, and the dynamic notch has little to do.  In many cases it can be turned off.  However, it can be useful for attenuating residual noise or frame resonance.  If there is no particular frame resonance, it will sort of hover around the middle of its range.  With the defaults, this keeps it out of the way, causing relatively little delay.  

If there is a specific resonance at some particular frequency, the min and max values can be centered either side of the resonance line.  For example, if you have 150hz resonance, try setting minimum to 100 and max to 200.

No matter how low you set the max value, the value used internally will never be less than twice the minimum value.  This is necessary to ensure the code works properly.

The 4.1 tuning guide notes about notch width and Q factor still apply... in short, when using the rpm filter:
```
set dyn_notch_width_percent = 0
set dyn_notch_q = 250
```

And this restores the default values for use without RPM filtering
```
set dyn_notch_width_percent = 8
set dyn_notch_q = 120
```


## Iterm Relax works properly in setpoint mode

There was a bug in 4.0 and 4.1 that affected of iterm relax setpoint mode.  Setpoint mode worked fine with defaults, but changing the `iterm_relax_cutoff` had almost no effect.  Gyro mode of iterm_relax was not affected.

That's why bounce back seemed to be better controlled by lowering `iterm_relax_cutoff` in gyro mode only.  Now, setpoint mode works correctly for all `iterm_relax_cutoff` values.  

We recommend that most users go back to setpoint mode in 4.2. 

When tuning `iterm_relax_cutoff`, to reduce I mediated bounce back after a flip or roll, aim for highest value consistent with adequate bounce back control.

To be sure that bounce-back in a freestyle quad is I related, and not due to something else, temporarily set `iterm_relax_cutoff` to a high value, eg 40, and make a test flight.  If the bounce-back definitely worsens, reduce the `iterm_relax_cutoff` value until it is adequately controlled.  

For most GoPro carrying modern freestyle quads, lowering `iterm_relax_cutoff` to around 10 should be enough.  For 7" builds perhaps 5-7.  X Class may need 5 or less.


## Configurator changes and improvements

The Rates configuration system is the most obvious change.  We can now see the shape of the curve for each kind of rates method, with their respective icons.
