# DRAFT - many things mentioned here have not been merged yet!

## [Betaflight 4.3](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/releases) brings:

Overall, a smoother, quieter, yet more precise flight experience than ever before, thanks to:

- [Presets](4.3-Tuning-Notes#Presets) - A fantastic, completely new preset system!  Whether a whoop, a twig, a 5" racer, a freestyle setup, or an X-class, we now provide a simple way apply a great tune for your quad, out of the box.
- [New tuning sliders](4.3-Tuning-Notes#New-tuning-sliders) - Whether you need to tweak the tune or build it from scratch, we now have simpler, more comprehensive, firmware based tuning sliders in the Configurator.  Slider positions are stored with the quad, and can be modified via the OSD as well  Pitch:roll responsiveness sliders too!
- [More accurate loop times](4.3-Tuning-Notes#More-accurate-loop-times) - Massive scheduler and DMA code improvements, including EXTI triggered SPI gyro reads (on supported boards), super stable looptimes, smoother filter performance, faster logging and improved CPU efficiency.
- [Multi dynamic notch](4.3-Tuning-Notes#Multi-dynamic-notch) - Completely rewritten, much improved, SDFT based multi-dynamic notches.  More than one resonant peak can be tracked at the same time, more accurately and more quickly than before, keeping motors smoother and cooler.  
- [PT3 based RC smoothing](4.3-Tuning-Notes#PT3-based-RC-smoothing) - RC smoothing has been completely revised, and is now entirely filter based, using PT3 (third order) smoothing.  The auto smoothing value provides anything from near-zero delay to exceptional cinematic smoothness.
- [RPM crossfading](4.3-Tuning-Notes#RPM-crossfading) - we now can smoothly disable RPM filtering entirely at low RPM.  This greatly reduces filter delay at low throttle.  You’ll hear an immediate difference in the sound of the motors, and get less propwash.
- [Feedforward jitter reduction](4.3-Tuning-Notes#Feedforward-jitter-reduction) - 4.3 introduces feedforward jitter reduction, which delivers a kind of ‘dynamic transition’ effect, allowing users to ditch transition.  You'll get silky smooth responses to slow stick inputs, and immediate, snappy feedforward responses to quick inputs.  Nirvana for HD freestyle.  Jitter reduction also attenuates RC link noise during slow movements, especially for the newer higher rate Rx links.  This replaces the old spike removal code.
- [Other feedforward improvements](4.3-Tuning-Notes#Other-feedforward-improvements) - We now have second order smoothing on boost, soft interpolation during slow stick moves, more accurate duplicate packet interpolation, so that most radios won't need averaging, which is now off by default.  
- [AntiGravity improvements](4.3-Tuning-Notes#AntiGravity-improvements) - I boost timing has been optimised to peak when it is most needed, and P boost applied also.  This provides greater stability during rapid throttle changes.  The default value of 3 should not be increased without careful testing.
- [Dynamic gyro filter expo curve](4.3-Tuning-Notes#Dynamic-gyro-filtering-expo-curve) - This improves propwash by raising dynamic gyro filter cutoffs faster as you throttle up.
- [Improved dynamic idle](4.3-Improved-dynamic-idle) - The dynamic idle code has been heavily revised, and can now keep RPM at a more stable value, more quickly and more precisely than before, thanks to a modified single sided PID controller.  It can now be configured to hold RPM above the normal idle value, improving motor spin-up-from-low-rpm behaviour, while allowing motor drive to go to zero for enhanced braking when appropriate.
- [Linear and Dynamic mixer options](4.3-Tuning-Notes#Linear-and-Dynamic-mixer-options) - These are alternatives to the stock Betaflight mixer code.  The dynamic option may result in less aggressive bump and landing responses for level mode or cinematic flights.
- [Feedforward in Level and Horizon Modes](4.3-Tuning-Notes#Feedforward-in-Level-and-Horizon-Modes) - Feedforward is now active in horizon and level modes, leading to quicker level mode angle changes, and making Horizon mode as responsive as Acro for flips and other fast moves.
- [Actual Rates as the new Betaflight default](4.3-Tuning-Notes#Actual-Rates-as-the-new-Betaflight-default) - Actual rates provide a simpler and more intuitive way to set your Rates, and are now the default.  Betaflight rates are optional.  *Take care when updating! If you copy and paste your old rates values, be sure to copy and paste the rates type also!*  Use this calculator to [convert your old rates to Actual rates](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/r5pkxlxhtb).
- [PT2 and PT3 lowpass filtering options](4.3-Tuning-Notes#PT2 -and-PT3-gyro-filter-options) - The old biquad lowpass filter option is no longer available, due to overshoot and resonance issues.  Users should change to PT2 if they need second order filtering.
- [CrossfireV3 and Ghost RC link improvements](4.3-Tuning-Notes#CrossfireV3-and-Ghost-RC-link-improvements) - As well as support for the latest Crossfire, ELRS and Ghost protocols, the internal betaflight RC code now supports 12bit or higher RC data in a float data path, handles very low RC Links (down to 16hz) better than before, fully supports high speed links to 1000hz, and better attenuates feedforward glitches when the RC link returns after dropouts.
- [FrSky OSD fix](4.3-Tuning-Notes#Frsky-OSD-fix) - Asizon fixed it!
- [Lua script updates](4.3-Tuning-Notes#Lua-script-updates) - RSSI in your OSD via LUA, slider control from the radio, amongst lots of other changes.


**NOTE 1**:The [latest 10.8 Betaflight Configurator](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases) is MANDATORY.  Earlier versions are not going to work properly!

**NOTE 2**: DO NOT paste a whole diff or dump from any prior build into the 4.3 CLI!  Invest the time in setting it up manually.  If you can use a Preset, do so.  If possible, use the sliders to approximate your old PIDs and filter settings.

**NOTE 3**: Check all your settings carefully before attempting to arm for the first time.  In particular, check your Rates!  READ THIS NOTE!  Before arming, double-check motor configuration and rotation in the Configurator motors tab.  For the first flights, arm in a safe place, and fly gently.

**NOTE 4**: We strongly recommend flying the default antigravity value and only increasing if that definitely improves things [see](4.3-Tuning-Notes#AntiGravity-improvements).  

**NOTE 5**: We strongly recommend using RPM based filtering.  Read about [enabling and configuring rpm filtering here.](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/Bidirectional-DSHOT-and-RPM-Filter)


**4.3 should fly really well on defaults, with no modifications, with most quads - but if a preset exists that resembles your build, use it!**


If you're new to Betaflight, please read the previous tuning notes ([4.2](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/4.2-Tuning-Notes), [4.1](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/4.1-Tuning-Notes) for any topic that isn't covered here.

## Quick settings 

These snippets are suggestions to suit a certain type of flying.  Generally, using a preset will work better.  I can't say that they will be perfect on your quad, and they do not include PID tuning or filter values, but illustrate how some of the new values can be adjusted to suit particular requirements.

### Bounceback

Please refer to the [4.2 tuning guide](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/4.2-Tuning-Notes#settings-to-minimise-bounceback).

### Random wobbles in HD footage
The following suggestions may help minimise this problem:
- tune for the highest possible D, avoid setting P too high
- set D_min at about 75% of DMax
- get D_max close to P, or up to 20% above P (you may need more D filtering - check the motor temperatures and don't go too high!)
- set TPA to D only (default), starting just below the cruising throttle value
- use about 2/3 the default I on pitch and roll
- make sure the ADC is not ticked in the hardware settings of OpenTx!!
- make sure the frame is super stiff and nothing is able to wobble or flap around
- be sure your capacitor is big
- sometimes the gyro chip isn't great, and some ESCs just don't play nice, if all else fails, try changing these parts from a quad that does fly perfectly.

### Zero throttle instability
- go back to 24kHZ PWM if you've set the ESc to 48kHz
- enable dynamic idle at 4000 RPM or whatever gives a solid spin on arming
- try thrust linear at 25
- try slightly higher overall PIDs

## Presets  ( *not merged yet* )

Betaflight's defaults originally were made to suit 5" freestyle machines for fun flying in the park.  These days there are huge performance differences between 5" race, freestyle and cinematic builds, and even greater differences between whoops, twigs, heavy camera builds, 7-10" and X-class builds.  They all have very different performance envelopes.

4.3 now provides a Preset system, in CLI snippet form, allowing specific, approved settings to easily applied to your quad during initial setup.

The new Presets tab in Configurator provides an easy and intuitive way to find, and apply, a preset that should be almost perfect for your machine.

Presets are 'approved' after evaluation via the GitHub 'pull request' method, and are not included in Configurator unless we are confident that they work really well.  To add a new Preset to Betaflight, open a [pull request](https://github.com/betaflight/firmware-presets/pulls).

Comments or feedback on any given preset should be provided via [github](https://github.com/betaflight/firmware-presets/pulls). 


## New tuning sliders ( *not fully merged yet* )

Betaflight's sliders have been improved a lot.  

Most importantly, the slider positions are now stored in the flight controller.  Slider settings can be changed via the OSD or Lua at the field, and those changes will be reflected in Configuator when you next connect up.  This really makes on-field tuning a lot quicker and easier.

Additionally, P and D are now independently set with their own specific sliders.  We don't set them indirectly via P:D ratio and P&D gain.  

This was a tough change to make, and we hope that it is a good one.

The overall balance and strength of P and D is now visually obvious from their respective slider positions.  

To maintain P:D ratio but increase combined P&D gain, simply move both sliders to the right in equal amounts.

Or, adjust D first, moving only the D slider, and then tune P once D is set appropriately.  Alternatively, adjust P first then tweak D.  

The new method supports whatever tuning 'method' the user prefers, including most of those in the familiar YouTube tuning videos.

Some additional notes....

Changing the P slider will also change I.  This helps avoid situations where people cut P  and then get I wobbles due to lack of P authority.  Since, typically, quads that can run high P can typically run high I, increasing both with one slider shouldn't be a problem.  However, if needed, you can go to Expert mode to fine-tune I with its own dedicated slider, which, in effect, locks in a P:I ratio.

We also now provide sliders to fine-tune roll settings relative to pitch.

The feedforward or 'stick responsiveness' slider hasn't changed.

We're confident that these sliders will work effectively for both beginners and experienced tuners, and simplify the transition from 'basic' to 'expert' tuning methods.  Most people, experienced tuners included, should now be able to use the sliders for nearly all their tuning requirements, both on and off the field.


## More accurate loop times  ( *not merged yet* )

Steve C Evans has made massive changes that almost completely eliminate PID loop jitter and improve the overall efficiency of the scheduler.  No special configuration is required; it just works. You'll get better filter accuracy, cooler motors and longer flights.

Boards with a hardware external interrupt line from gyro to FC will be able to sync gyro data to the FC more immediately and precisely.

In 4.3 it's best to run F405 and F411 boards at 4k, not 8k, if RPM filtering is enabled.  F411's should be overclocked to 120Mhz; they don't run hot like F405's.

DShot600 now works reliably on most boards including F411's.  DSHot300 isn't recommended unless there are RPM errors in the motors tab that only go away if you choose DShot300 (some, but not many, FC's or ESCs still need DShot300 ).

Blackbox logging over SPI is now much more efficient, so that higher logging rates will work with fewer gaps.  Even so, logging is a significant time consumer, so turn it off if you don't need it, and only log as fast as is needed, eg 1kHz for normal purposes, 2Khz for filter tuning.

If running 4k PID loops we strongly suggest always keeping the gyro lowpass 2 filter active, to avoid aliasing when downsampling the gyro. Otherwise if gyro lowpass 2 is disabled at 4k, a simple 2-point averaging filter is enabled in its place. This is not nearly as good an anti-aliasing filter as a PT1 filter at 1000hz, and nowhere near as good as 500hz. For 2kPID loops, a 500hz PT1 lowpass 2 gyro filter is absolutely necessary. 

8k PID loops have no aliasing issues, so gyro lowpass 2 can be disabled without aliasing concerns.


## Multi dynamic notch

The new SDFT based notch can track multiple independent noise peaks, and will assign an independent notch filter to each peak.  The user can specify as many notches as they need.  Usually mo more than two or three are needed, depending on the build, and often only one.

The SDFT tracks noise peacks much more effectively than before.  The code is completely different.  It has been optimised to control resonance problems when used in association with RPM filtering.  The RPM filter is still best for RPM related noise.

Q values around 300-450 work well for freestyle applications.  Keeping the minimum value as high as practical (eg 200hz), and only using the minimum number of notches, will minimise notch related filter 'delay'.

To tune the dynamic notch properly, make a log with the dynamic nothch off, do a spectrum analysis and see if there is resonance that needs to be controlled, and what the resonant frequencies are.  Set the dynamic notch range to include the resonant peaks, fly again, and check that the incoming resonance lines have gone from your gyro traces.  Then repeat with higher Q values to find the highest Q value that adequately control those resonances.

For quads that cannot run RPM filtering, the SDFT code will work reasonably effectively if configured with three or four notches and Q values around 120.

For more detail see [PR #10554](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/10554)


## PT3 based RC smoothing

The RC smoothing system has been simplified and improved.  Cinematic or HD pilots can now get amazingly smooth results that were impossible before.

The old linear interpolation method has been removed because the PT3 filter-based method works better.

We very strongly recommend keeping rc smoothing 'on' at all times - ie with `set rc_smoothing = ON`.  If you turn it off, your motors will get very notchy drive signals, run hotter and noisier, and lower link speeds will shake the quad at link frequency.  

The auto smoothing algorithm hasn't changed,  It detects your RC link speed on arming, sets the RC smoothing cutoffs automatically, and changes their values if the link speed changes in-flight (though it takes a while to do so).

The default auto smoothing value is now 30, which gives a reasonably well-smoothed setpoint line and very little delay when compared to the un-smoothed signal.

For HD freestyle, an auto value of 60 will provide greater smoothness and not a whole lot of extra delay.

For cinematic video, where absolute smoothness is needed, auto values around 90-120 will give that silky effortless smoothness you are after, at the cost of obvious stick delay.  In association with jitter reduction and feedforward smoothing, most cinematic footage will be incredibly smooth.

The auto smoothing function adjusts the filters to give the least delay for the given link speed.  At higher link speeds, the smoothing filters run faster, and give quicker stick responses.  

For cinematic flying with a fast radio link, and for crossfire in a non-locked mode, it may be best to manually over-ride the auto smoothing, to get a consistent amount of smoothness throughout the flight, and across builds with different radio links.  This can be done by by setting fixed, non-auto, values in the CLI.  For cinematic purposes, 10-15hz works well, regardless of link speeds, eg

```
set rc_smoothing_setpoint_cutoff = 10
set rc_smoothing_feedforward_cutoff = 10
````

The same applies to non-locked crossfire, which can swap between 50Hz and 150Hz, randomly.  Here a value of 20-30hz will give reasonably consistent stick feel and reasonable smoothness even in 50hz mode:

```
set rc_smoothing_setpoint_cutoff = 30
set rc_smoothing_feedforward_cutoff = 30
````

We generally don't advise going below 30 for auto smoothness, though at high link speeds, eg 250 or 500hz, a value of 20 may be good for racing, by keeping delay to the absolute minimum.  There will be some transfer of the RC link frequencies into your motors, but not much.  If you can hear a difference, or your motors run warmer, go back to 30.

Slower RC Links may benefit from a little more auto rc smoothing than faster links, eg 45 or 60 for 50hz, with it's big, wide steps, or higher to 90-120 if absolute smoothness is needed.

In most cases, stick with the default auto smoothing, and once you've decided on your radio link speed, or after changing radios, adjust the auto smoothing value to get the result your after.

The auto value for throttle is independently adjustable, automatically or manually, depending on whether you want to smooth throttle or not.  I think its best left at 30, unless you are a high link speed racer and want to try 20; if you want to avoid throttle jumps on a cinematic build, go higher, but be wary of throttle lag when you need to pull up from a dive :-)

The auto smoothing is applied equally to setpoint and feedforward.  The log header will show the actual frequencies being used with your link.  In the CLI you can manually configure the amount of smoothing on feedforward relative to setpoint.  We are not sure that this is useful, in any practical sense.  It makes more sense to control stepping in feedforward by using feedforward_smoothing; heavy RC smoothing on feedforward will delay it quite a lot.

For more detail see [PR #10650](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/10650)


## RPM crossfading  ( *not merged yet* )

This is a brilliant improvement over normal RPM filtering, which gives much cleaner motor signals at low to mid-throttle, and improves propwash considerably.  Basically we now can have the RPM filtering benefits when we need them, with none of the drawbacks when they are not needed.

We discovered that notch filters operate by generating an 'anti-noise' signal at their specified cutoff frequency.  They don't generate 'delay' in the conventional sense.  Not in the same way that a lowpass filter does.  They make a signal which, when mixed with the original, 'cancels out' the noise in the original signal.

This means that we can attenuate a notch filter in a linear fashion, by 'cross-fading', or 'mixing', it's 'anti-noise' signal in, or out, like an audio mixer.

This is extremely useful for RPM filtering.  Previously, when any motor went below the minimum RPM frequency, its three RPM notches would all remain active, but be held at their minimum frequency.  While there was no noise to remove, they generated 'delay' and reacted to nearby frequencies, and causing a form of intermodulation distortion, and worsening propwash.

Now, we can essentially 'turning the RPM filters off' when they aren't needed, and bring them back on smoothly over a 'cross-fade' range above the minimum rpm value.

Once the rpm filters are completely 'off', they cause no delay or interference of any kind, resulting in cleaner and better gyro traces than before.

In most builds, significant RPM related noise doesn't start to happen until about 100hz (6000 rpm).  So we can start the RPM filtering at say 80hz and cross-fade it over 50hz, so that by 130hz, or 10,000 rpm, you have full RPM filtering active again.  eg:

```
set gyro_rpm_notch_min = 80
set gyro_rpm_notch_fade_range_hz = 50
```

We have found a cross-fade range of 50hz to be optimal in most cases.

The default minimum RPM value, where RPM first starts to 'switch on', at 80hz, also works well for most quads.  Machines with very clean props and very little intrinsic RPM noise can have this value shifted higher, eg 

```
set gyro_rpm_notch_min = 100
set gyro_rpm_notch_fade_range_hz = 70
```

Very large quads with low RPM we would choose proportionally lower values.

For more detail see [PR #10757](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/10757)


## Feedforward jitter reduction  ( *not merged yet* )

This is a really exciting change that gives real smoothness when you want it, while keeping a ton of snap when you want it as well.  

It completely removes any need to use the old Dterm/feedforward 'transition' functionality anymore.

Feedforward, especially with boost, is known as the 'stick responsiveness' parameter, and for good reason.  It provides a strong and immediate reaction to stick inputs.  A good amount of feedforward (say 120-130) will make the quad super responsive, without adding overshoot.  It gives those 'snap' freestyle inputs extra zing, and gives race pilots near-zero setpoint-to-gyro lag.

However, it accentuates even the most tiny of RC inputs, and can make for twitchy flight and jerkiness in HD video.  It doesn't matter if those RC twitches come from nervousness, slightly sticky or noisy gimbals, RC link connection problems, they all get exaggerated by feedforward.  Until now.

The 'old' way to handle these 'jitters' was to use feedforward transition, which linearly attenuated feedforward down to zero when your sticks were close to the center position.  This solved the problem of 'too much feedforward' at centre stick position - but nowhere else.

And transition has a number of limitations.  It only works when the sticks are centred; if you are in a smooth turn, all your jitter can come back.  When you move the sticks across the centre, in a smooth move, transition will cut the feedforward out abruptly at centre, causing a wobble, worst with narrow transition ranges.  If you do make the transition range wide, you lose all feedforward in the middle, so you can't snap out, and then you'll overshoot on the extremes of stick position because feedforward will be too late to activate.

Jitter reduction attenuates feedforward strongly when the sticks are moving slowly, regardless of their absolute position.

Think of it as a kind of 'dynamic transition' function.

The default value of 7 works best for most quads with normal radio links, and is suitable for racing, ensuring that tight turns, and high-speed straights, are both smooth and responsive.

Experienced race pilots with higher speed links will find that the straight-line sensitivity will be a bit less than normal, because for very small inputs, their feedforward 'push' is attenuated.  They may prefer a value of 5.  After a few flights we find that the quad 'stays on the intended line' a fair bit better than before, especially during tighter turns, which feel more 'on rails' than before.

A value of 12-15 pretty much removes all feedforward from slow smooth inputs, and is what we suggest for freestyle/cinematic.  The quad will be equally smooth in straight centred flight and in a sustained tight turns.  However, if you flick the sticks, the response will be immediate.

How it does this magic is simple, in principle.  We look at how much the RC command values change from packet to packet, average the two most recent change amounts, and compare that average to a user-configured threshold.  We then fade out the feedforward values when the recent rate of RC change is below the threshold.  But when the RC command changes are bigger than the threshold, we let feedforward through, unchanged and without any delay, to give immediate snap responses when we move the sticks quickly.

The `feedforward_jitter_reduction` number is the threshold for the RC Command change, in tenths of a percent of stick travel, below which feed-forward is attenuated.  A value of 10 means feedforward will be attenuated progressively for RC command changes of less than 1% per step.  Attenuation below the threshold follows a kind of exponential curve, so that with a value of 10, there will be barely 10-20% of the normal feedforward for rcCommand change steps of 0.1% to 0.2% of the full RC range.

Both link frequency and link bit depth have an impact on a suitable jitter reduction value.  At low link frequencies, eg 50hz, most RC steps are large, and there really isn't much of a jitter issue to worry about.  So the defaults and the suggested freestyle values actually do OK for 50hz to 150hz.  

Higher link speeds, eg 250hz, run into a problem where there is only a limited number of steps available, and not much time for a change to be detected.  Crossfire and FrSky protocals only provide 800 steps across the full RC range, or only 400 steps from centre to max position.  If the pilot moves the stick slowly over one second to max, some RC steps will be one, and others two, packets high.  Small steps like that vary by 100% from step to step, leading to a lot of jitter in feedforward, which thinks that the sticks are shaking massively.  The person's intrinsic jitter and the gimbal itself makes jitter noise of at least this magnitude, and feedforward would ordinarily amplify it - just like D amplifies gyro noise.  

This is where the jitter reduction code helps remove that residual noise in higher speed links; its kind of like a dynamic, zero delay filter, applied to feedforward when the signal to noise ratio would be bad.  It applies first order filtering to the simple setpoint derivative and second order filtering to the boost element.  

Hence the jitter reduction system markedly reduces gimbal jitter on all systems, but is most effective, and important, in higher link rate systems with only 800 steps.  For that reason we suggest keeping it at the default value on all RC links, increasing it for freeestyle and cinematic, and maybe dropping back to 5 but only on clean RC links for race purposes.

The newer 11 bit RC link protocols with 2000 steps will provide better resolution, however gimbal noise will remain a problem, and hence the jitter reduction code is likely to remain needed for the forseeable future.

For more detail see [PR #10670](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/10670)


## Other feedforward improvements

A number of small, but significant, feedforward changes result in a smoother signal with less delay.

All parameters in the CLI that relate to feedforward now start with `feedforward`, not `ff_`.  Go `get feed` to list them all.

The old `ff_smooth_factor` code has been updated, and it is now named `feedforward_smooth_factor`.  It provides second order step height smoothing for boost, as well as the usual first order smoothing to the simple derivative.  This gives more effective smoothing of the boost signal with less delay to the simple derivative.

A suitable starting value of 25 is adequate for most builds.

`feedforward_averaging` is now set to 'off' by default, since most builds won't require it.  It should be set to `3_POINT` to provide three point moving averaging for old Crossfire 150l links.  Noisy 500hz RC links may benefit from `2_POINT` averaging, but the new jitter reduction code means that 250hz and lower are usually OK without averaging.

`feedforward_max_rate_limit` replaces `ff_max_rate_limit` and is the value that pulls back on feedforward as the sticks approach their maximum rate, minimising overshoot when hitting max stick position.  A bug that limited its usefulness has been fixed.  A value of 90 works best for most quads.  

Duplicate packet interpolation has been improved.  Since duplicates occur frequently at slow stick movement speeds, we now use the jitter reduction value to attenuate the interpolation process, so that we interpolate very little when the sticks are moving very slowly.

These changes give us a much smoother but super responsive feedforward system.


## AntiGravity improvements

Antigravity now increases P during hard throttle chops, since the abrupt change in pitch angle needs more than I to control it.  Additionally, the timing of the I boost has been changed to better match the timing of the wobble.

The default is now only 3.0, reflecting the greater efficiency of the new code.

Note that it is unwise to run very high AntiGravity values in 4.3, because you run the risk of significant P and I wobble during throttle chops.

Stick to values close to defaults.

If you do want to increase AntiGravity, test it methodically.  High values, eg 5 or more, may not achieve much more than normal values; use the lowest value consistent with reasonable control.

See [#10163](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/10163) for more detail.


## Dynamic gyro filter expo curve

`dyn_lpf_gyro_curve_expo` allows the dynamic lowpass filter cutoff value to rise more quickly with throttle increases than it used to.  It works much the same as the D lowpass expo.

This reduces delay at higher throttle positions.  If you get significantly more high frequency noise at higher throttle, reduce the amount of expo, or reduce the upper value of the dynamic lowpass cutoff.

For graphs see [PR9486](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/9486).

## Improved dynamic idle

The new dynamic idle code now provides a full PID controller.  In place of the `idle_adjustment_speed` and `idle_p` tuning settings, we now have
```
set dyn_idle_p_gain = 50
set dyn_idle_i_gain = 50
set dyn_idle_d_gain = 50
```
This provides more precise RPM control.  The overall concept of dynamic idle is unchanged - [see the notes, which are out of date a bit, here] (https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/Tuning-Dynamic-Idle).

Typically higher power quads will need lower PID values, and those with lower authority may benefit from higher PID values. 

A simple test is to set the dynamic idle RPM value well above the normal idle, eg set it to 4000rpm (40), which should be well above normal idle RPM on most quads, and see how stable the motors sound at idle.  If they aren't changing speed or oscillating, the PIDs are OK.  If they are, try less overall PIDs.  If they seem to be wandering around, try more.  Generally the defaults are OK.

Quite a lot of logs show that ESCs have difficulty quickly generating thrust from slow RPM.  Dynamic idle, when set to a fairly high minimum RPM, eg 40, can prevent RPM falling low in reverse airflow states.  This will improve responses when starting and stopping a flip at zero throttle.  

The new code is so good that I can fly my quads (with old BLHeli-S ESCs) on 1% DShot idle and only 1200 rpm as a minimum dybamic idle RPM.  The prop blades are visible turning slowly during LOS flips and rolls, but they don't desync.  For more general freestyle applications, a minimum dynamic idle RPM of 4000, and for racing of 3000, with a DShot idle of 4% usually works really well.

## Linear and Dynamic mixer options

When airmode is active, the default betaflight mixer prioritises PID authority over throttle.  Anytime a motor might need to be driven 'below zero' in order to maintain authority, throttle is increased by airmode so that the requested motor differential can be achieved.  

This airmode-driven throttle increase is the only reason why we can flip and roll 'normally' at zero throttle.

However, there are downsides.  Airmode leads to strong reactions on impacts; the quad will get more throttle and climb.  There is a fairly abrupt change in authority once the limits that Airmode can provide are reached.

These alternate mixer models change the relative emphasis between throttle authority and PID control.

They may have some use in smooth cinematic flying styles, providing a kind of partial airmode effect with less bounce on landing at the expense of limited low throttle PID performance in quicker moves.  If interested, just fly and see if you like them or not.

For more detail see [PR #10370](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/10370)


##Feedforward in Level and Horizon Modes ( *not merged yet* )

In 4.3, feedforward now is applied to both Level and Horizon modes.  

In Level Mode, this results in a quicker response when moving the sticks to quickly change the angle of the quad.

In Horizon Mode, while flying aggressively, the behaviour is now nearly exactly the same as acro, with all the benefits that feedforward brings, in terms of immediate stick response and reduced overshoot.  It feels great!  

In both cases, responsiveness is quicker for the level component.  If you're a beginner and you find it too twitchy, reduce the feedforward value in the PIDs.

For more detail see [PR #10778](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/10778)


## Actual Rates as the new Betaflight default

Starting from 4.3, Actual Rates will be the new Betaflight default.  See PR #10724 for graphs and more information.

`ACTUAL` rates lets you set both the target centre sensitivity and the maximum roll rate in degrees/second.  

The two values are independent of each other.  

Expo shifts the transition point between the two rates to be closer to centre (at zero) or further out (at max).

This online calculator allows visualisation of Betaflight rates vs Actual Rates.  

The new defaults are NOT exactly the same as the old Betaflight rates.  Although the max rate is the same (670 deg/s), the new defaults are softer in the centre (centre sensitivity of 70, compared to about 200 in Betaflight's old defaults), and more responsive further out.  See the [image in the pull request](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/10724).

It is hoped that these will be easier to learn on and better suited to freestyle.  

Some experienced race pilots use 200deg/s centre sensitivity and 620 max, with no expo.  With the jitter reduction code, 200deg/s gives very quick turn-in but remains smooth and controllable in tight turns.  Others prefer lower values.

Betaflight rates users can use this [rates calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/r5pkxlxhtb) to find an Actual rates equivalent to what they currently fly.  For instance, centre of 200, max 670, and expo of 0.58 results in the original default Betaflight rates curve.

If a user pastes in their Betaflight rates numbers from say a 'diff all', the `rates_type` information will not be included.  The result will be that Actual Rates will be active, but with Betaflight CLI numbers.  The quad will be un-flyable!  That's why its a bad idea to copy and paste diff all's.  Be sure to recreate your Rates manually, or, if you do a copy and paste, be sure to include the `rates_type` line from the CLI dump command when pasting your rates in.

## PT2 and PT3 lowpass filtering options

In the past, the second-order Biquad filter was available as an option for gyro and D smoothing, when first-order filtering wasn't enough.  However, we have learned that it oscillates with step inputs and overshoots near cutoff, and won't be using it anymore for lowpass filtering anywhere in the code.

If you needed second order gyro filtering, use the PT2 option, which works much the same.

The PT3 option is a very strong filter, and doesn't have much of an application for gyro or D lowpass filtering, except perhaps as the sole dynamic lowpass on D.

Compared to a PT1, filter delay increases by about 60% with a PT2 and doubles with a PT3.

For more detail see [PR #10727](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/10727)


## CrossfireV3 and Ghost RC link improvements ( *not merged yet* )

4.3 has a fully float based internal RC data path, resulting in no aliasing or loss of resolution regardless of RC packet contents.  We also support Crossfire V3 and 11bit Ghost protocols.

We also better support very low frequency link rates - down to 16hz - by constraining the RC smoothing, and avoiding false packet timeout errors which would otherwise trash feedforward  And we support up to 1000hz links by allowing deviations to 950ns without declaring an error.

Blackbox logs now show un-smoothed rcCommand, and the RC and feedforward debugs show un-smoothed Roll setpoint and other useful data for RC link quality and resolution checking.
