## Dshot & BetaFlight 3.1   
Dshot is new and currently code is being developed and tested. Since there are many dependencies and not all current hardware works this is to help keep track.

The Official Thread for Dshot is: https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2756129   
Please Read this thread for details of how it works and up to date info. The First Post of this thread has all the needed Links to code and other info. A good article on Dshot and ESC protocols is here:

[BetaFlight V3.1 released](/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/BetaFlight-V3.1.x)  
Just remember that this is still Experimental code and may have serious limitations.  
Read here to Learn exactly what firmware issues and features are being worked on:  
https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc  

The Latest Development version of the Configurator is recommended. Link on [Home page](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki).  

Some known limitations are:  
 3.1 seems most issues are fixed. Any issues discovered should be in the 3.1.X wiki page now.

- All STM32F1 Target do not support DSHOT
- Some ESCs that have a signal filter cap may not work until the cap is removed. 


####A quick way to determine IF the Firmware flashed into the FC supports Dshot:  
Go to the CLI and type "get pwm". All settings with 'pwm' in the name will be shown with all options.
If DSHOT150, DSHOT300, DSHOT600 is NOT in the list for the "motor_pwm_protocol" then this firmware does NOT support Dshot.
Example for NAZE that does Not support Dshot: 

motor_pwm_protocol = ONESHOT42  
Allowed values: OFF, ONESHOT125, ONESHOT42, MULTISHOT, BRUSHED

####Setting Min Throttle with Dshot   
Dshot now uses the CLI command "digital_idle_percent" which adds to the 'min_throttle'.
Do type "get idle" to see if this exists and what the valid values are. This is a percentage of throttle used in armed state. The pid controller will never push use motor output below this percentage. Test it out by arming while watching the motors tab. If the motors idle slower when using dshot, bump up the digital idle percent. I set mine to 4.000 to make my motors arm at the same speed when swapping back and forth between multi and dshot. 

####ESC Cal and min/max throttle
ÃŸF firmware with Dshot does Not use the min_throttle or max_throttle setting, these are ignored.
Just ensure that in the ESCs (BLHeli Suite) that PPM_MIN_THROTTLE is set to 1000 and PPM_MAX_THROTTLE is set to 2000.
Note: This should not be needed in BLHeli_S 16.43 and up since the PPM_MIN & MAX values are not used for Dshot.   
this means that when DSHOT is use NO ESC Calibration is required. Just Select DSHOT.

####Max ESC update speed supported by different dshot versions:  
#####WARNING: due to processor tasks, FC and/or ESC, the maximum update rate may not work-  
#####TEST without props and a Current Limiter.  

Theoretical speeds are a lot higher. The speed is limited in firmware to give more spreading between signals.
- DSHOT150: 4kHz max
- DSHOT300: 10,6kHz max (10,6khz is only available on 32khz gyro boards)
- DSHOT600: 16kHz max
- DSHOT1200: >32khz max (Currently only KISS24 supports DSHOT1200)

Note: When DSHOT is enabled Unsyced PWM is disabled. DSHOT always runs at the PID loop rate.  

####Dshot digital Values:  
0 = disarmed.  
1 to 47 = Reserved for special commands.  
48 to 2047 = Active throttle control.

USE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION AT YOUR OWN RISK

BETAFLIGHT AND DSHOT -

Betaflight may not be able to support all Targets ( or specific boards) due to the design of each one differing on the DMA pinout. Look below to find what may or may not be working.

###FC Targets that work with Dshot but require hardware mods and re-mapping pins with the Resource command:   
Boris' comment:  
  I had many requests for MOTOLAB (and other FCs) but that one doesn't have DMA available on all motors. It may be that we will assign one of the motors to PPM pin so you can resolder it. Not great, but better than nothing I guess?  

#####General instructions for re-mapping pins:   
 1- All FCs that require using the FC's PPM input pin as a motor output therefore can NOT use a PPM RX. Any of the Serial RXs that use a UART do work. Set-up Serial RX normally as needed for the FC board.  
 2- Check pins for the FC board below on which STM32 pins need to be re-mapped. It is a Good Idea to first type in the CLI:  
`resource  `  
`resource list  `  
and copy/paste these into a Text file and save for reference of the Default pin Mappings.    
  3- In the config tab select OneShot(42 or 125). Click Save. Leave this select until pins are re-mapped.  
  4- In the CLI type (x = motor #, yyy = STM32 pin #):   
`resource ppm none  `  
`resource motor x yyy  `  
`save  `  
  5- Now select the DSHOT protocol of your choice.  

See: [CLI resource command](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/Betaflight-resource-remapping)    

- ALIENFLIGHTF4  
 Move the motor 2 wire to the PPM pad at the bottom of the board. There are updated board designs available with an added DSHOT solder jumper at the bottom which is making this connection. In this case, you can leave the motor 2 soldered output #2. Note: a PPM receiver can not be used in this configuration.   
 Enter the following commands into the CLI window to re-map output:  
`resource ppm none  `  
`resource motor 2 A08 `  
`save  `  

- MOTOLAB - (MotoF3, Cyclone & Tempest)   
 Move motor 1 from Output #1 header pin to the PPM input header pin.   
 Follow above and to re-map output type in CLI:  
`resource ppm none  `  
`resource motor 1 A07 `  
`save  `  
 
- PIKOBLX - Re-map motor 1 to the PPM pin (same as MotoLab) and to allow the use of the LED pin Re-map motor 4 to motor 5 signal out, which must also be soldered as such. Also disable motor 5-8 ("resource motor X none").    
 Solder motor 1 to the PPM selector pin leaving the BSUS jumper 'shorted'.
Note: RX must use SBUS since PPM pin is now reassigned to motor 1.
Link to modification details: https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=36608148&postcount=43149  
 Follow above and to re-map output type in CLI:  
`resource ppm none  `  
`resource motor 1 A07 `  
`save  `  


- SPRACINGF3EVO -  Must move MOTOR 4 to new pin assignment (CLI = resource MOTOR 4 A06). Then solder ESC for motor #4 to motor output #5, fixes DMA conflict with motor outputs 2 and 4.  
 Follow above and to re-map output type in CLI:  
`resource motor 5 none  `  
`resource motor 4 A06 `  
`save  `  

- SPRACINGF3MINI - Move motor #4 to the PPM pin. Then use resource command to disable PPM and map motor 4 output to B04.  
 Follow above and to re-map output type in CLI:  
`resource ppm none  `  
`resource motor 4 B04 `  
`save  `  

Limitation: BlackBox on the internal SDCard works with MultiShot but not with DShot.  

- KOMBINI - Move motor #1 from Output #1 header pin to the PPM input header pin.  
 Follow above and to re-map output type in CLI:  
`resource ppm none  `  
`resource motor 1 A07 `  
`save  `  

Limitation: no LED functionality with DShot is allowed.  
Video on getting this FC working: https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=36269451&postcount=1966    

- AIORACERF3 -  Must move MOTOR 2 to new pin assignment since it has a DMA conflict with MOTOR 1:    
Connect ESC for motor 2 to 'LED' pin on the board.  
 Then re-map motor 2 output: type in CLI:    
 `resource motor 2 A08`  
 `save`  
 The new mapping for motor 2 conflicts wit `LED_STRIP` and `TRANSPONDER`, so make sure these two features are disabled in the configurator.   

####FC Targets with DSHOT code added but in need of testing:
- SPARKY2
- All other targets not listed above.   

###ESCs supporting Dshot:
- KISS 24 - 150, 300, 600, 900, 1200 See the Dshot thread (link above) for ESC code.

####BLheli-S:

DSHOT on BLHELI_S ESCs is supported starting with v16.43 and Offically supported in v16.5 and Up. 
Older ESCs with BB1 processor will likely only support Dshot150 & 300.
Here is why: https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=36025232&postcount=376   
Now found that all BLHeli_S ESCs will run on DSHOT150, 300 & 600 if using a BB2 processor and any input signal filtering is Removed. See list below for details on removing filter cap.  
[DSHOT O'scope captures](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=36490579&postcount=2631) before and after the typical RC filter.  

BLHeli_S Rev16.6 posted on github (10Jan2017).   
[Get Firmware from Github here](https://github.com/bitdump/BLHeli). Check for the latest ESC firmware in BLHeli Github and BLHlei Suite and Documents.   

See [BLHeli_S Knowledge Base](https://github.com/blheli-configurator/blheli-configurator/wiki/BLHeli_S-Firmware-Knowledge-Base) for Which HEX to use.  

Note: Many of these ESC have an RC filter on the control input signal line. The cap of this RC filter must be removed to use Dshot as per the list below. It is recommended to remove the cap from any ESC even if Dshot seems to work. All other protocols will still work without this filter cap.  
Many ESCs are now being built and shipped without the signal filter Cap but it is best to check yourself to ensure the cap is not installed.

#####An Over View from Cheredanine:  
Folks there are various people posting stuff that clearly don't understand or haven't read the wiki. So to straighten stuff out:
Min and max throttle
D shot does not use it. "I changed min throttle" - well that's nice but pointless

######Calibration
You don't need to do it, it doesn't make any difference to dshot, claibration is about calibrating PWM pulse length, dshot is a serial protocol, not PWM, don't waste your time

And the most important -
######Caps on or off and the wiki
Caps on the signal line smooth the signal, removing jitter. Dshot is a rapid change of signal, it looks like jitter, the faster the signal, the more chance the caps will smooth it out, obliterating the signal. Because dshot is 16bits, some signal,values look more like jitter than others. The signal is also effected by other factors than just the caps

So removing caps makes d shot more likely to work BUT the records in the wiki are not black and white, they are a record of what people have claimed to work, your quad with the same escs may not react the same. (I have 2 quads with exactly the same escs, one works fine up to dshot300 with caps on, the other needs caps off for dshot at all)

######with caps off Motors are smooth from the motor tab but I get jitter on sticks
So dshot is fine, when you use your sticks the radio, the reciever, the wiring to the receiver, the gyro, the physical components of the quad and the PID loops are all combining, something somewhere is causing the flight controller to command the shakes you are seeing, fix the problem and stop worrying about dshot

######Will dshot work with these escs ......
Dshot will work on blheli_s escs (and of course kiss but there is now a seperate thread for kiss) if the escs are flashed with a version of blheli_s that supports it and the caps don't interfere with the signal. Bb1 processors will not do faster speeds, but bb2 will do up to dshot600. Just because the esc doesn't overtly say it on the literature - dshot came out after many blheli_s escs - or because it is 4 in 1 or 2 in 1 or 0.5 in 1 , well perhaps not the last, but if it is blheli_s bb2 make sure the caps are removed from the signal line and it will run dshot

So if you want to run dshot - TAKE THE CAPS OFF (manufacturers are starting to ship with out the caps on)
If you don't and you have problems, then gues what?   

#####Note: there are ESCs that are exactly the Same sold by different names.  
It is good to check the pictures in the Cap removal links and compare to the ESC you have in your hand.

https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=36216745&postcount=1645   

#####Cap Removal Methods:  
*Caution - if improper done can render the ESC unusable and have the possibility to burning the ESC upon applying power. *  
- Method 1. Clippers - used this when there is enough room, just clipped the cap in half the clipped each end off the board  
- Method 2. Craft knife - used when other components are too close to use clippers, for example tbs escs - slide the blade so that it is sliding along the surface of the board and in a direction away from other components and apply force, cutting the cap off the esc   
- Method 3. Soldering iron - Heat both ends of the cap with a tinned iron. Then wipe the cap off the pads with the iron's tip. Be Careful NOT to unsolder any other parts and examine the board with a good magnifier for any solder splashes.
