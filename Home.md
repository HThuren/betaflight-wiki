# Welcome to the BetaFlight Wiki!

New to Betaflight and just want to get started see the [installation](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/Installing-Betaflight) section.

##Introduction
"Due to many questions about my latest Cleanflight improvements and tests here is some more central information about it. The motivation for this project is to bring the end users closer to the development. As my main focus in Cleanflight is the flight improving development. A flight test group like this is very useful.
The BetaFlight fork is from the current Cleanflight master with possible future Cleanflight flight performance enhancements.

This project also helps by contributing to other open source projects like iNav." - says Boris B ([lead developer](http://www.youtube.com/user/bozic1982/featured))

##Tools
Betaflight is also always being adjusted to support most current Cleanflight tools like Configurator and EzGui devices and many other MSP tools. There is no special tool needed just for betaflight.

##Firmware Releases
Releases can be found here: https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/releases or download the latest successful build directly from source (these are bleeding edge and may be unstable): http://andwho.sytes.net:8080/job/BorisB_BetaFlight/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/obj/

##Configuration Tool
To configure Betaflight you should use the Betaflight-configurator GUI tool (Windows/OSX/Linux) that can be found here:  
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/betaflight-configurator/kdaghagfopacdngbohiknlhcocjccjao

The latest configurator and source for it is here:  
https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator  

Instructions (from the README.MD file in the download):    
1. Clone the repo to any local directory or download it as zip  
2. Start Chromium or Google Chrome and go to tools -> extension  
3. Check the "Developer mode" checkbox  
4. Click on load unpacked extension and point it to the Betaflight Configurator directory (for example D:/betaflight-configurator)    
Then you'll see the new configurator in your Chrome extensions.
