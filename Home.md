# Welcome to the Cleanflight wiki!

Much of the documentation has moved to the same place that the code is found since it is easier to keep the documentation up to date when changing the code and this helps with accepting code and documentation contributions.

## Current documentation

Please reference current documentation here:

https://github.com/hydra/cleanflight/tree/master/docs

For baseflight related documentation (i.e. if not found in the main documentation) see here:
