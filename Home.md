# Welcome to the BetaFlight Wiki!

New to Betaflight and just want to get started see the [installation](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/Installing-Betaflight) section.

##Introduction
Betaflight is a Cleanflight fork started by BorisB. It used to work as a beta test platform for Cleanflight and kept pushing the envelope in terms of performance, but it eventually evolved into a fully grown up, stable and well maintained firmware by various developers. In fact it looks like it is the number 1 open source multi-rotor firmware according to Google Trends analysis around January 2017.

The name "Beta" comes from the fact it started with a goal to keep trying new things out and have quick and easy test distributions available. The name "Beta" has stuck as the brand name was strong at the moment where it transitioned from beta to stable and there was already a lot of documentation around.

"This project also helps by contributing to other open source projects like iNav." - says Boris B ([lead developer](http://www.youtube.com/user/bozic1982/featured))
