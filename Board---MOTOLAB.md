## Description
Four FCs that all use the same Target HEX

- MotoF3- Board shape designed for the ImpulseRC Warp Quads as part of the frame.   
- Tornado- Does not allow BLHeli Pass-through due to have 5V uni-directional drivers on the motor output pins.  
  Requires a Pololu 5V regulator mounted on the board.
- Cyclone- Like the Tornado but supports BLHeli pass-through and has the 5V regulator built onto the board.  
- Tempest- Has PDB built into the board as well as a 5V regulator to power accessories.

## FAQ & Known Issues

- Tornado has output driver chips so can not add a wire to the output pin header to use DSHOT.  

- To use DSHOT ESC protocol with ÃŸF3.1 Motor1 needs to be re-mapped to the PPM pin. See the [DSHOT & Betaflight](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/DSHOT%20ESC%20Protocol) page.  

A wire can be soldered from the PPM pin to the motor 1 header pin or just connect ESC#1 directly to the PPM pin.
Note: Adding this wire is not required if you connect signal wire from ESC #1 directly to the PPM pin.  
 Move motor 1 from Output #1 header pin to the PPM input header pin.   

 Follow above and to re-map output type in CLI:  
`resource ppm none  `  
`resource motor 1 A07 `  
`save  `

- Report that with the Mod and remapping to run DSHOT there is a conflict with DMA for LEDs with Motor #4.  
Currently LEDs need to be disabled to run DSHOT. 

### Tri-copter with Dshot ESCs on BF3.1:  
Must add wire from PPM to output1 for Dshot.
Servo must be on output 5 or 6 (Timer restriction: see SERVO_TILT wiki page). Do NOT enable SERVO_TILT, selecting TRICOPTER directs Yaw stick to Servo 1.  
Re-map motor 5 to Servo 1 with the following CLI commands (servo on output 5):

`resource MOTOR 5 none  `   
`resource servo 1 A01  `   
`save  `  

### Hex-copter with Dshot ESCs on BF3.1:  
This did not seem to work. No DSHOT output on motor 1 (No DMA assignment) and bad output on motor 6.
