## Description
Four FCs that all use the same Target HEX

- MotoF3- Board shape designed for the ImpulseRC Warp Quads as part of the frame.   
- Tornado- Does not allow BLHeli Pass-through due to have 5V uni-directional drivers on the motor output pins.  
  Requires a Pololu 5V regulator mounted on the board.
- Cyclone- Like the Tornado but supports BLHeli pass-through and has the 5V regulator built onto the board.  
- Tempest- Has PDB built into the board as well as a 5V regulator to power accessories.

## FAQ & Known Issues

To use DSHOT ESC protocol with ÃŸF3.1 Motor1 needs to be re-mapped to the PPM pin. See the [DSHOT & Betaflight](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/BetaFlight%20and%20Dshot) page.  
A wire can be soldered from the PPM pin to the motor 1 header pin or just connect ESC#1 directly to the PPM pin.
Note: Adding this wire is not required if you connect signal wire from ESC #1 directly to the PPM pin.
