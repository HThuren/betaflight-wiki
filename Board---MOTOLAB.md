###MotoLab has four FCs that all use the same Target HEX

- MotoF3- Board shape designed for the ImpulseRC Warp Quads as part of the frame.   
- Tornado- Does not allow BLHeli Pass-through due to have 5V uni-directional drivers on the motor output pins.  
  Requires a Pololu 5V regulator mounted on the board.
- Cyclone- Like the Tornado but supports BLHeli pass-through and has the 5V regulator built onto the board.  
- Tempest- Has PDB built into the board as well as a 5V regulator to power accessories.
