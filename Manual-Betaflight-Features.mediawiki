Im sure this needs to be revised but this is what I started a couple weeks ago in te thread.

'''set rc_smoothing''' = OFF 
Interpolation of Rc data during looptimes when there are no new updates. This gives smoother RC input to PID controller and cleaner PIDsum
 
'''set rc_fpv_cam_correct_degrees''' = 0
 Need feedback about proof of concept feature for mixing of roll and yaw to FPV cam angle. set rc_fpv_cam_correct_degrees = <degrees>
 
'''set enable_fast_pwm''' = OFF
 
'''set gyro_lpf''' = OFF ''Must me set to off to enable 2K mode''
 F1 boards must also'''set acc_hardware = 1
Hardware lowpass filter for gyro. Allowed values depend on the driver - For example MPU6050 allows 5,10,20,42,98,188,256Hz, while MPU3050 doesn't allow 5Hz. If you have to set gyro lpf below 42Hz generally means the frame is vibrating too much, and that should be fixed first. Values outside of supported range will usually be ignored by drivers, and will configure lpf to default value of 42Hz.
 
'''set imu_dcm_kp''' = 2500
 
'''set imu_dcm_ki''' = 0
 
'''set beeper_off_flags''' = 256
  beeper_off_flags = sum of each desired beeper turned off
