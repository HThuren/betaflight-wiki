## Description

`The full size, 35x35mm (30.5x30.5 mounting holes).KakuteF4-V1 is Designed around the STM32F4 MCU and ICM20689 IMU. The ICM20689 is the new gyro designed by Invensense, itâ€™s low noise floor and high reliability rate makes it a top choice for FPV flight controller.F4 processor runs at 168MHz, it allows you to run high loop times.Flight logging can be writed to onboard 32 MBytes SPI flash.`
