## Description

`Board size  is 35x44.5mm with 30.5x30.5mm mounting holes.`
`KakuteF4-AIO is designed around the STM32F4 MCU and ICM20689 IMU. 

## MCU, Sensors and Features

### Hardware

  - MCU: STM32F405RGT6
  - IMU: ICM20689 (SPI)
  - OSD: MAX7456
  - SPI Flash: MX25L25635FMI
  - Integrated Voltage Regulator: 7v~42v input,5V/1.25A output
  
### Features

  - WS2811 Led Strip: implemented.
  - VCP: Yes.
  - Hardware UARTS: 3
  - OSD: MAX7456,directly configured by betaflight-configurator.
  - PPM/UART Shared: UART6
  - Battery Voltage Sensor: Yes, onboard, no wiring necessary
  - Battery Current Sensor: Yes, onboard, no wiring necessary
  - Integrated Voltage Regulator: Yes, 7v~42v
  - Buttons: 1 - DFU
  - CAN Bus which is very useful for talking to external devices.
