These settings are specific to betaflight. For cleanflight CLI docs go here

The setting shown are the Defaults + possible values.

'''set rc_smoothing''' = OFF <br />
<i>[OFF,ON]</i><br />
Interpolation of Rc data during looptimes when there are no new updates. This gives smoother RC input to PID controller and cleaner PIDsum<br />

 
'''set roll_yaw_cam_mix_degrees''' = 0<br />
<i>[0..50]</i><br />
Need feedback about proof of concept feature for mixing of roll and yaw to FPV cam angle. set roll_yaw_cam_mix_degrees = <degrees>
<br />
Here a good preview for this option: [https://youtu.be/gXeaINFpvow FPV camera tilt compensation]
 
'''set enable_fast_pwm''' = OFF<br />
<i>[OFF,ON]</i><br />
 
'''set gyro_lpf''' = 188HZ '' <br />
<i>[OFF,188HZ,98HZ,42HZ]</i><br />
Must be set to OFF to enable 2K mode (starting with Version 2.3.3)''
 F1 boards must also set acc_hardware = 1 Disabling any level modes
Hardware lowpass filter for gyro. Allowed values depend on the driver - For example MPU6050 allows 5,10,20,42,98,188,256Hz, while MPU3050 doesn't allow 5Hz. If you have to set gyro lpf below 42Hz generally means the frame is vibrating too much, and that should be fixed first. Values outside of supported range will usually be ignored by drivers, and will configure lpf to default value of 42Hz.

'''set acc_hardware''' = 0 (default on) (must be set to 1 for 2K mode on F1 targets)<br />
<i>[0,...,9]</i><br />
Sets the accelerometer 0 means auto detect, 1 means off, 2 for ADXL345, 3 for MPU6050 integrated accelerometer, 4 for MMA8452, 5 for BMA280, 6 for LSM303DLHC, 7 for MPU6000, 8 for MPU6500

'''set baro_hardware''' = 0 (default on), 1 = disabled<br />
<i>[0,...,3]</i>

'''set mag_hardware''' = 0 (default on), 1 = disabled<br />
<i>[0,...,3]</i>
 
'''set imu_dcm_kp''' = 2500<br />
<i>[0,...,50000]</i>
 
'''set imu_dcm_ki''' = 0<br />
<i>[0,...,50000]</i>
 
'''set beeper_off_flags''' = 256<br />
<i>[0,...,65535]</i>

beeper_off_flags = sum of each desired beeper turned off
 
 +BEEPER_GYRO_CALIBRATED, 1

 +BEEPER_RX_LOST_LANDING, 2 // Beeps SOS when armed and TX is turned off or signal lost (autolanding/autodisarm)

 +BEEPER_RX_LOST, 4 // Beeps when TX is turned off or signal lost (repeat until TX is okay)

 +BEEPER_DISARMING, 8 // Beep when disarming the board

 +BEEPER_ARMING, 16 // Beep when arming the board

 +BEEPER_ARMING_GPS_FIX, 32 // Beep a special tone when arming the board and GPS has fix

 +BEEPER_BAT_CRIT_LOW, 64 // Longer warning beeps when battery is critically low (repeats)

 +BEEPER_BAT_LOW, 128 // Warning beeps when battery is getting low (repeats)

 +BEEPER_, 256 // when plugged into USB

 +BEEPER_RX_SET, 512 // Beeps when aux channel is set for beep or beep sequence how many satellites has found if GPS enabled

 +BEEPER_DISARM_REPEAT, 1024 // Beeps sounded while stick held in disarm position

 +BEEPER_ACC_CALIBRATION, 2048 // ACC inflight calibration completed confirmation

 +BEEPER_ACC_CALIBRATION_FAIL, 4096 // ACC inflight calibration failed

 +BEEPER_READY_BEEP, 8192 // Ring a tone when GPS is locked and ready

 +BEEPER_MULTI_BEEPS, 16384 // Internal value used by 'beeperConfirmationBeeps()'.

 +BEEPER_ARMED, 32768 // Warning beeps when board is armed (repeats until board is disarmed or throttle is increased)
 
'''set acc_lpf_hz''' = 20<br />
<i>[0,...,200]</i>
 
'''set soft_gyro_lpf_hz''' = 60<br />
<i>[0,...,255]</i>
 
'''set dterm_lpf_hz''' = 0<br />
<i>[0,...,255]</i>
 
'''set acro_plus_factor''' = 0<br />
<i>[0,...,100]</i><br />
Range is 0-100. If set to anything other than 0 roll and pitch rates in the GUI will be ignored. RC rate and RC expo still apply . Warning 100 results in insane rolls and flips that may result in your inability to comprehend. Use at your own risk!
