## Description

The [Crazyflie 2.0](https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyflie-2/) is a brushed nanocopter development kit sold by [Bitcraze AB](https://www.bitcraze.io/) out of Sweden. The flight controller board is the copter itself - the PCB is X-Shaped and plastic motor mounts slide on to the arms. It features an integrated NRF51 SoC for Rx. 

The Crazyflie 2.0 has an extensive [expansion deck](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:crazyflie2:expansionboards:index) system with various decks that plug in to the expansion headers to enable various additional functions like buzzers, LEDs, indoor localization, and even an ESC breakout designed for mounting the board on a larger brushless build.

The board has its own operating system and set of client side tools which enable all the functionality of these decks and the copter. This Betaflight/Cleanflight port is designed to enable the core flying scenarios, and is not necessarily intended to enable the features of all the various decks.
