IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT

## Betaflight v3.2 will be the last version to include STM32F1 based flight controllers. From v3.3 onwards support for those flight controllers will no longer be provided, this includes the NAZE, CC3D (original), ALIENFLIGHTF1 and MICROSCISKY and their clones.

If you have any questions or concerns please advise in Boris' BetaFlight thread. Providing notice here so that there is plenty of time to prepare. v3.2 will be released in October, whilst v3.3 won't be until next year.

You can see some information here : https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/projects/2 however it doesn't look complete.

From Boris (30 June 2017):   
Well release candidate is around the corner.
Basically a lot of fundamental changes. Not much of those will affect the user, but there are also quite some new features as well.   
The major complain about Betaflight was too frequent updates in the past. So we slowed that down. Not having the pressure for quick releases gives some time for thinking and researching new things.  

Current V3.2 files are here: https://ci.betaflight.tech/job/Betaflight/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/obj/ 
or https://betaflight.qmd.cl/

### Note: When discussing this Version in the Forums (Boris' BetaFlight thread)   
## Please State: Version and Build Number.


### From Boris:

## Instructions for Upgrading - 

DO NOT use Copy/Paste of CLI commands since many have changed- either names or new ones.
Use the latest Configurator to setup then the CLI Tab and manually set.

## New features and changes of how old feature work

### Switching from 'tlm_inversion' to 'tlm_inverted'

With the change of the configuration parameter `tlm_inversion` to the parameter `tlm_inverted`, the scope and function of the parameter have changed:

- `tlm_inverted` applies to **all** telemetry protocols;
- `tlm_inverted = on` means that telemetry is expected to be inverted **compared to what it is for the selected protocol** (i.e. when using SmartPort, `tlm_inverted = off` means that the flight controller expects the telemetry signal to be inverted serial, since this is the default for SmartPort).

_This means that for all protocols, if unmodified hardware is used `tlm_inverted = off` is most likely the correct setting._

(Also, note that this only works for F3 / F7 based boards, or for F4 boards on ports with switchable external inverters.)

### Dynamic Filters

TO DO - fill in CLI commands and what they do.


This is the current signal path in ascii art:

gyro -> dynamicNotch -> notch1 -> notch2 -> lpf -> P term                                           
-> motors    
                                               \-> D term -> notchD -> lpfD -> setpointRelax&Weight /    

### Crash Recovery

TO DO - fill in CLI commands and what they do.

TCHTHSKY Posted in Boris' thread-
[Here's the code for it. It has comments: ](https://github.com/kc10kevin/betaflight/blob/master/src/main/flight/pid.c)   
[And here is the feature request: ](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/issues/2731)   
[And here's this: ](http://stackissue.com/betaflight/betaflight/added-experimental-crash-detection-and-recovery-2783.html)   
[Here's another from earlier in this thread:](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=37951070&postcount=49982)   

Important note from mjbudden:  
The crash recovery routine does not currently attempt to limit yaw spin - it just tried to level the quad. I did not anticipate the "yaw spin to the moon" problem when I wrote the crash recovery routine. I'm now working on a solution. See PR github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/3909 in github for the current discussion on the subject. Feel free to contribute to the discussion. Also black box logs of "yaw spins to the moon" are very welcome and will help analyze and solve the problem.   

### Turtle Mode  

TO DO - Describe what this does, how to setup and which ESC firmware supports this.
