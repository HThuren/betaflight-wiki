If you have any questions or concerns please advise here. Providing notice here so that there is plenty of time to prepare. v3.2 will be released in October, whilst v3.3 won't be until next year.

From Boris (30 June 2017):
Well release candidate is around the corner.
Basically a lot of fundamental changes. Not much of those will affect the user, but there are also quite some new features as well.
