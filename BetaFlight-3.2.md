IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT

## Betaflight v3.2 will be the last version to include STM32F1 based flight controllers. From v3.3 onwards support for those flight controllers will no longer be provided, this includes the NAZE, CC3D (original), ALIENFLIGHTF1 and MICROSCISKY and their clones.

If you have any questions or concerns please advise in Boris' BetaFlight thread. Providing notice here so that there is plenty of time to prepare. v3.2 will be released in October, whilst v3.3 won't be until next year.

You can see some information here : https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/projects/2 however it doesn't look complete.

From Boris (30 June 2017):   
Well release candidate is around the corner.
Basically a lot of fundamental changes. Not much of those will affect the user, but there are also quite some new features as well.   
The major complain about Betaflight was too frequent updates in the past. So we slowed that down. Not having the pressure for quick releases gives some time for thinking and researching new things.
