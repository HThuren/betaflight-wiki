# KakuteF7

## Description

`The Holybro Kakute F7 All-In-One flight controller makes it easy to build your multirotor. It integrates flight controller (FC), power distribution board (PDB), and on-screen display (OSD) in one. `


## Features
`•Supports Betaflight and Cleanflight.`

`•Betaflight OSD. Change PIDs, adjust common configuration parameters, and change video transmitter channel and power level, all using your transmitter sticks and goggles.`

`•Soft-mounting built in. The “gyro” chip on this board is mounted on vibration-isolating foam. This means that there is no need to soft-mount the board itself.`

`•New high-performance / low-noise / high sensitivity IMU. ICM20689 with 6-axis gyro and accelerometer. Can run at up to 32 kHz.`

`•2 oz copper PCB allows up to 120A maximum continuous current.`

`•Dedicated bootloader button for easy firmware flashing.`

`•Low-profile design fits into even very compact frames.`

`•Input voltage 7v to 42v. Power the board directly from the flight pack, up to 6S (on “BAT” pad only).`

`•Automatic voltage monitoring. No need to run a separate vBat wire for voltage monitoring; the Kakute F4 AIO monitors voltage directly from the battery power lead.`

`•Filtered voltage output for clean, noise-free video. On-board regulators output 5v at up to 1.5 amps and 3.3v at up to 200 mA to power peripherals such as receiver, video transmitter, FPV camera, or LED strip.`

`•Supports BLHeli passthrough for easy ESC upgrade and configuration.`
