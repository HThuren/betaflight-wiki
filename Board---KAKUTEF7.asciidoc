# KakuteF7

## Description

`F7 is a newer generation MCU, it is a faster processor (216MHz). F7 offers more UART’s with built-in hardware inversion and it F7 has superscalar pipeline and DSP capabilities – basically that means the F7 is a better platform for future development that allows the developers to further optimize the flight controller algorithms.

## Benefits of KakuteF7 Compared to KakuteF4
`F7 is a faster processor (216MHz vs 168MHz of F4)`

`F7 offers more UART’s with built-in hardware inversion`

`F7 has superscalar pipeline and DSP capabilities – basically that means the F7 is a better platform for future development that allows the developers to further optimize the flight controller algorithms`

`The faster speed F7 processor allows for faster looptime in theory without overclocking like we do with F4 running 32KHz`
