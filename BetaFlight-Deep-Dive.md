##Gyro based loop implementation
------------------------------------------------
Gyro update is leading the loop. The loop will start after interrupt is triggered for new gyro sample. The PID controller will always be doing the calculation of the most fresh gyro value. The sampling gyro rate of 1khz will be used and that will automatically run looptimes of 1000us or 500us depending of configuration and target capabilities. This also makes the looptime setting unnecessary. There is no need for this parameter as our gyro decides when loop will run. There is no drift between gyro and control loop and your PID tune will be consistent. No aliasing should be experienced. This also helps filters to do better job in giving clean gyro traces.
